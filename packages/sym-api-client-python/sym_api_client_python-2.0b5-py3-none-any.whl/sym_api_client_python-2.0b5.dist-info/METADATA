# Symphony BDK for Python

This is the Symphony BDK for Python to help develop bots and interact with the [Symphony REST APIs](https://developers.symphony.com/restapi/reference).

Legacy Python BDK is located in the master branch of this repo.

## Installation and getting started
The [reference documentation](https://symphonyplatformsolutions.github.io/symphony-api-client-python/) includes detailed
installation instructions as well as a comprehensive
[getting started](https://symphonyplatformsolutions.github.io/symphony-api-client-python/markdown/getting_started.html)
guide.

## Build from source

The Symphony BDK uses and requires Python 3.8 or higher. Be sure you have it installed before going further.

We use [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) in order to manage dependencies, build, run tests and publish.
To install poetry, follow instructions [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).

On the first time, run `poetry install`. Then run `poetry build` to build the sdist and wheel packages.
To run the tests, use `poetry run pytest`.

It is possible to run pylint scan locally (on a specific file or package) executing the following command:
`poetry run pylint <module_name>`.

To generate locally the Sphinx documentation, run: `cd docsrc && make html`.
