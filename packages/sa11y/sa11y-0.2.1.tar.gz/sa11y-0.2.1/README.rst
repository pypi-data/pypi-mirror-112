Sa11y
==========================

The Selenium Accessibility Package

Get basic accessibility information using
the `axe-core npm library <https://www.npmjs.com/package/axe-core>`_
on websites visited using `Selenium <https://www.selenium.dev>`_.

Contact `Deque <https://www.deque.com>`_ for more information about axe™ functionality and results.

Note: This project does not support all of the features available in axe™, but is
provided for the flexibility and convenience of Ruby users.


Prerequisites
--------------

* Install `python`
* Install `pip`
* Install `npm`

Installing
--------------

    $ pip install sa11y

Usage
-------------

Just pass in a valid driver instance to the `Analyze` class constructor and call the `#results` method.

    driver = webdriver.Chrome()
    Analyze(driver).results()

By default, sa11y inspects elements in all frames and iframes on the page.
If your site does not use frames, you can improve performance slightly by turning off frame checks:

    driver = webdriver.Chrome()
    analyze = Analyze(driver, frames=false)
    analyze.results()

By default, sa11y does not inspect frames from cross origins. If you need to analyze frames
originating from a different domain, you need to turn this on:

    driver = webdriver.Chrome()
    analyze = Analyze(driver, cross_origin=false)
    analyze.results()

This gem comes packaged with the latest axe™ version at release. If you want to change this, specify the JS library you want to use:

    driver = webdriver.Chrome()
    js_lib = open("tests/resources/old.axe.min.js", "r").read()
    Analyze(driver, js_lib=js_lib).results()

Development
-------------

This project will be developed in Python 3.x so please create a
`virtual environment <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/>`_:

    python3 -m venv venv

    source venv/bin/activate

To install dependencies, do the following:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

To install required scripts:

    python setup.py npm_install


Deployment
-------------

The project needs to include a dynamically generated `axe.min.js` file, and can be built with this command:

    python setup.py npm_install install sdist

To release, makes sure you have twine installed and run:
    twine upload -r  pypi dist/*
