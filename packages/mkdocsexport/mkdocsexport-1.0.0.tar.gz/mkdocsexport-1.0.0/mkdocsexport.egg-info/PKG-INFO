# Export docs

**Description**:  Export documents to a single file. It makes use of a template so the format can be whatever you want (JSON, CSV, One big HTML file, what-ever).

## Dependencies

mkdocs > 1.1

## Configuration
Configuration options:
export_filename: Name of the exported file. Defaults to `docs.json`
export_folder: Folder to save export into. Defaults the global `site_dir` setting (works with `mkdocs serve` as well)
export_template: Path to the file which contains the template for the export page. It is `None` by default, which means that the package-provided template is used. It can be an absolute path, or relative to the folder in which `mkdocs` is run.

Add configuration to mkdocs.yml

```python
plugins:
  - mkdocsexport:
    export_filename = "filename.ext"
    export_folder = "path/to/folder"
    export_template = "path/to/template"
```

## Usage

Install this plugin (it will also install mkdocs if required)

```shell
pip install mkdocsexport
```

or

```shell
pip install git+https://github.com/philips-labs/MkdocsExportPlugin.git
```

### Customization

The layout of the exported page is a jinja2 template file. The package provides such a template by default, with the following content:

```markdown
[
    {% for page in pages %}
    {
        "title": "{{page.title}}",
        "file": "{{page.file.name}}",
        "content":"{{page.content|escape}}"
    }{%if loop.nextitem %},{%endif%}
    {% endfor %}
]
```

You can also provide your own template. The `page` object contains all the metadata in a mkdocs page, and in addition a `.filename` attribute, which contains the file name of the source of the page (relative to the docs folder), which can be used to link to that page.
