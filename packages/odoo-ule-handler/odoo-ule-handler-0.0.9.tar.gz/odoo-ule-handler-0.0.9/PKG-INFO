        This repository is not linked to the PyPi repository (https://pypi.org/project/odoo-ule-handler/), so new versions must be manually created and deployed.
        The process is really simple: clone the GitHub repository and execute the following command:
        
        > Warning: you should use a virtual enviroment for dependency/library management.
        
        - pip install twine
        
        - python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
        
        - twine upload dist/*
        
        Introduce the PyPi account credentials and you are done.
