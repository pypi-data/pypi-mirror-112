All denovo containers have a 'contents' attribute where an item or items are
internally stored. This is used instead of the normal 'data' attribute used in
base python classes to make it easier for users to know which object they are
accessing when using either 'contents' or 'data'.

Contents:
    Proxy (Container): basic wrapper for a stored python object. Dunder methods 
        attempt to intelligently apply access methods to either the wrapper or 
        the wrapped item.
    Bunch (Iterable, ABC): abstract base class for denovo's replacements for 
        lists and dicts. All subclasses must have an 'add' method, a 'subset' 
        method, and store their contents in the 'contents' attribute.
    Manifest (MutableSequence, Bunch): denovo drop-in replacement for a python 
        list with additional functionality.
    Hybrid (Manifest): iterable with both dict and list interfaces.
    Lexicon (MutableMapping, Bunch): denovo's drop-in replacement for a python
        dict with some added functionality.
    Catalog (Lexicon): wildcard-accepting dict which is primarily intended for 
        storing different options and strategies. It also returns lists of 
        matches if a list of keys is provided.
    Library (object): registry for storing, accessing, and instancing classes
        and instances.

class Proxy(collections.abc.Container):
    """Basic wrapper class.
    
    A Proxy differs than an ordinary container in 2 significant ways:
        1) When an 'in' call is made, the '__contains__' method first looks to
            see if the item is stored in 'contents' (if 'contents' is a 
            collection). If that check gets a TypeError, the method then checks
            if the item is equivalent to 'contents'. This allows a Proxy to be
            agnostic as to the type of item(s) in 'contents' while returning the
            expected result from an 'in' call.
        2) Access methods for getting, setting, and deleting try to 
            intelligently direct the user's call to the proxy or stored object.
            So, for example, when a user tries to set an attribute on the proxy,
            the method will replace an attribute that exists in the proxy if
            one exists. But if there is no such attribute, the set method is
            applied to the object stored in 'contents'.

    Args:
        contents (Any): any stored item(s). Defaults to None.

        Add more dunder methods to address less common and fringe cases for use

            methods for adding to a python iterable ('append', 'extend', 
            'update', etc.) remain, but 'add' allows a subclass to designate the
            preferred method of adding to the iterable's stored data.
        2) It allows the '+' operator to be used to join a Bunch subclass 
            instance of the same general type (Mapping, Sequence, Tuple, etc.). 
            The '+' operator calls the Bunch subclass 'add' method to implement 
            how the added item(s) is/are added to the Bunch subclass instance.
        3) The internally stored iterable is located in the 'contents'

class Hybrid(Manifest):
    """Iterable that has both a dict and list interfaces.
    
    Hybrid combines the functionality and interfaces of python dicts and lists.
    It allows duplicate keys and list-like iteration while supporting the easier
    access methods of dictionaries. In order to support this hybrid approach to
    iterables, Hybrid can only store items that are hashable or have a 'name' 
    attribute or property that contains or returns a hashable value.

    A Hybrid inherits the differences between a Manifest and an ordinary python 
    list.
    
    A Hybrid differs from a Manifest in 3 significant ways:
        1) It only stores hashable items or objects with 'name' attributes or 
            properties that contain hashable items.
        2) Hybrid has an interface of both a dict and a list, but stores a list. 
            Hybrid does this by taking advantage of the 'name' attribute or
            hashability of stored items. A 'name' or hash acts as a key to 
            create the facade of a dict with the items in the stored list 
            serving as values. This allows for duplicate keys for storing items, 
            simpler iteration than a dict, and support for returning multiple 
            matching items. This design comes at the expense of lookup speed. As 
            a result, Hybrid should only be used if a high volume of access 
            calls is not anticipated. Ordinarily, the loss of lookup speed 
            should have negligible effect on overall performance.
        3) Hybrids should not store int types. This ensures that when, for 
            example, a 'hybrid[3]' is called, the item at that index is 
            returned. If int types are stored, that call would create 
            uncertainty as to whether an index or item should be returned. By
            design, int types are assumed to be calls to return the item at that
            index.

        2) It recognizes a 'default' key which will return all values matching

            initial value of 'default' is 'all'.
        3) It recognizes a 'none' key which will return an empty list.
        4) It supports a list of keys being accessed with the matching values 
            returned. For example, 'catalog[['first_key', 'second_key']]' will 
            return the values for those keys in a list ['first_value',
            'second_value'].
        5) If a single key is sought, a Catalog can either return the stored
            value or a stored value in a list (if 'always_return_list' is
            True). The latter option is available to make iteration easier
