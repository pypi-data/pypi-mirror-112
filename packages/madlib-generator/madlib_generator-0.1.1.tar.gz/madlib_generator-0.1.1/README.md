# madlib_generator
I made this in a few hours because I was bored and thought it would be funny. This uses the [google-research-datasets/sentence-compression](https://github.com/google-research-datasets/sentence-compression) dataset as a base for it's dictionary and sentence list.

## Installation
```
pip install madlib_generator
```

## Usage
```
>>> import madlib
>>> madlib.get_madlib()
'Two fugitives were deposed borrowing to scrap crime: their childhood handles.'
```
 
## "They don't make any sense"
Like a 5-year-old's madlib, it's just filling random words of the right type.
That means most of the outputs are barely syntactically correct:
```
FoxyMoron is nationwide de-emphasized up to arrest its monks in the Capital.
RMIT has capitalized a Wexford.
newsday lay DURRINGTON rests CONMAN.
An African quay has evaluated a Ofer Holdings Group waveguide guy.
The Schlumberger will fight new 5 and $ 10 Hull beers next Eusebio.
National baseball Hall of Fame has rementioned classmate of its first smartclip Bread, an attendance.
ruby would avoid its Hardware.
Paul Johnson insisted NAN 27.
Radio descendant SECP has been godown bankrupt.
Datarock and Leonard Boswell are bulldozed to default married next Canister.
Zoltan Gera would have added Community Transit assuming.
The new international spear at Har Homa monologue may be interdicted open for mudslide in July.
```

Though sometimes it strikes gold:
```
Plaster Rock considered his hunger.
welfare mother is remaining the hosepipe plunder.
A major founder has upgraded southwestern Pakistan.
All Revellers jetted off in the dark pizzas.
The real bassist Reports.
Taylor Cleared his Household.
Wells Fargo & Co. is clearing its Canadian Islanders.
A zebrafish subsoil is listening to blueberry with RD over a battered Puss.
```
