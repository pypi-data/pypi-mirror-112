Automatic Workflow Documentation
================================

Generates a `Graphviz <https://graphviz.org/>`_ file (or directly creates an SVG) from a Zope/CMF DCWorkflow defintion.

Usage:
------

- in ZMI got to the workflow which you want to document.

- there are two additional tabs one for raw DOT data file, one for a rendered SVG file.


Features:
---------

- generation of Graphviz file with states and transitions.
- each state shows a permissions-table
- each transition shows its guards.

Todo:
-----

- add views to control_panel

Installation
============

Just depend in your buildout on the egg ``collective.wfautodoc``.
When used within Plone ZCML is loaded automagically with ```z3c.autoinclude```.
Otherwise add the package to buildout section ```instance``` ```zcml``` variable.

 This package is written for Plone but works also in a pure  Zope2/CMF environment.
