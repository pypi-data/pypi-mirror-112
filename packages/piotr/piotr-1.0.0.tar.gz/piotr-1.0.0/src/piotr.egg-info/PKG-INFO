Piotr provides an easy way to create, run and share virtual IoT devices. It is suitable for
trainings (especially remote trainings) where embedded device emulation is required. 

Piotr provides a set of useful command-line utilities to manage the emulated devices and interact with them,
and a Python API to allow automation. Thus, it is easy to spawn an emulated device, interact with its system,
remotely debug a specific process and exploit some vulnerabilities for instance.
