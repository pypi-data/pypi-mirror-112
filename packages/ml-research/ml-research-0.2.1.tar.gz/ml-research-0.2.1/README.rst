Research
========

This repository contains the code developed for all the publications I
was involved in. The LaTeX and Python code for generating the paper,
experiments' results and visualizations reported in each paper is
available (whenever possible) in the paper's directory.

Additionally, contributions at the algorithm level are available in the
package ``research``.
