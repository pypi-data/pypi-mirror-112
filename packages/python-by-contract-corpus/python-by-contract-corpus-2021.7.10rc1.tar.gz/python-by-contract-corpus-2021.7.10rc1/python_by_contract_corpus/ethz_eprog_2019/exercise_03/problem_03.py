"""
Compute a greatest common divisor (GCD) between two positive integers ``x`` and ``y``.

Please note:

1) If ``x`` is greater-equal ``y`` and ``x`` is divisible by ``y``, the GCD between
   ``x`` and ``y`` is ``y``.
2) Otherwise, the GCD between ``x`` and ``y`` is ``GCD(y, x % y)``.

For ``x == 36`` and ``y == 44``, the GCD is 4.

Do not use ``math.gcd`` function.
