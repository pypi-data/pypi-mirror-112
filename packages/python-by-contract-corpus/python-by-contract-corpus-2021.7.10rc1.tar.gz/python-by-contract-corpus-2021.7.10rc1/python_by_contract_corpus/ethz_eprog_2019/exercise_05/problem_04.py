"""
Analyze the booking data of a hotel.

The data is given as:
* The room number,
* The beginning of the booking interval (as an integer, the day of year),
* Tne end of the booking interval (as an integer, the day of year),
* The price of the room per day,
* The price discount (as a floating point number between 0 and 100).

All bookings start and end in the same year.

The program answers the following questions:
* Which room was booked the most frequently? (as number of bookings)
* Which room was booked the longest (as number of days)
* Which room brought in the most revenue?
* What is the total revenue of the hotel for the year?
