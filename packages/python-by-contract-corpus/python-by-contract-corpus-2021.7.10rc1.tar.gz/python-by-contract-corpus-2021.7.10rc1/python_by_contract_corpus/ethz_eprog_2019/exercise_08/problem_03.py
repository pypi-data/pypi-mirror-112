"""
Simulate a shopping queue in discrete steps.

Here are the inputs:

* Number of checkouts with the respective efficiency ``p_0, p_1, ..., p_n`` with
  ``0 <= p_i < 1``.
  In every step, the cashier ``i`` scans with a probability ``p_i`` an item from the
  shopping cart of the customer at the front of the queue. When all the items from
  the shopping cart have been scanned, the customer leaves the queue.
* A new customer shows up with a probability ``e, 0 <= e < 1`` at every step and
  enters one of the queues at random.
* The size of the shopping cart ``w``. Every customer has a random number of items
  between 0 and ``w``.

(We removed the feature "laziness factor" from the original problem statement.
The feature was not very clear to us, and would not have had much impact
on the contracts.)

Provide the following metrics of the simulation:

* ``finished``: Number of people who left the queue at the end of the simulation.
* ``avg_queue_lengths``: A list of the average length of each queue during
  the simulation
* ``max_queue_lengths``: A list of the maximum length of each queue during
  the simulation
