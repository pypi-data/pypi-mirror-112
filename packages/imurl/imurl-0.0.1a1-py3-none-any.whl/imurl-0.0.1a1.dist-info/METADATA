`imurl` is (...will be?) an immutable URL library, written in modern Python.

`imurl` is heavily inspired by both [`purl`](https://github.com/codeinthehole/purl) and [`pathlib`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html),
and aims to be an easy library for simple URL manipulation in Python. Like `pathlib` paths, imurl URLs are immutable and operations can only create
new URLs.
