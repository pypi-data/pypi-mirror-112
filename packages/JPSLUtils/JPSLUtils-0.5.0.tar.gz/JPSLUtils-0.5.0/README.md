## JPSLUtils
(aka Jupyter Physical Science Lab Utilities)

#### Introduction
These are utilities used by multiple packages within the Jupyter Physical
Science Lab project. It is unlikely that anyone but a developer would
have reason to install these independently. They are installed when
required by other packages/modules.

#### Contents
This package mostly provides tools for running javascript operations that
impact the notebook. This includes things such as selecting a certain cell,
inserting text into an existing cell, or running python code and using the
result from javascript. Some custom dialogs for user interaction are also
included.
