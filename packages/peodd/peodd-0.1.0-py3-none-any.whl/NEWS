## peodd 0.1.0 - (2021-07-07)

**New features:**

 * Add script for exporting poetry dev-dependencies to a txt file\
   Poetry has an option to export the dependencies to a txt file. If you
   need the dev dependencies too, then you need add `dev` flag with the
   export command. But, there is no support to export only the dev-
   dependencies. This script is a workaround & quick-solution to this
   problem.  It can export the dev-dependencies to a requirements-dev.txt
   file. Usage: ``` $ peodd -o requirements-dev.txt ```
