        A set of Python utilities used as part of the bird suite of bioinformatic tools,
        developed by the Woodcroft research lab at the Centre for Microbiome Research at
        the Queensland University of Technology. The classes and functions inside are
        often heavily opinionated to reduce downstream coding effort and to standardise
        UI. They may change without warning.
