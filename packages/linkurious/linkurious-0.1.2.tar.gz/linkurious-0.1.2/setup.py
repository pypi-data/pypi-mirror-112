    'long_description': '## Description\n\nlinkurious is a [tortilla](https://github.com/tortilla/tortilla) based python wrapper around the\n[Linkurious HTTP REST API](https://doc.linkurio.us/server-sdk/latest/apidoc/)\nthat allows users to remotely manage a Linkurious instance, performing the same tasks\nthat can be done through the web application.\n\nThis can be useful to:\n- automate some of the most tedious tasks\n- integrate the Linkurious instance within a wider multi-services application\n\n[Linkurious Enterprise](https://linkurio.us/product/) is a copyrighted graph visualization and analysis platform,\nthat allows users to perform queries and build visualizations on multiple graph databases (Neo4j, CosmosDB, JanusGraph).\n\n## Installation\n\nPython versions from 3.6 are supported.\n\nThe package is hosted on pypi, and can be installed, for example using pip:\n\n    pip install linkurious\n\n## Usage\nThe package only has one class (and one exception), creating a `Linkurious` instance passing username and password\nwill connect to the instance. All following operations will be performed using the same user session. \n\n    from linkurious import Linkurious\n    \n    # login\n    l = Linkurious(\n        host=\'https://linkurious.example.org\', \n        username=\'user@mail.org\', \n        password=\'****\', \n        debug=False\n    )\n    \n    # query execution\n    query = """\n    MATCH (p:Person)-[i]-(m:Movie) where m.id=12\n    return p, i, m\n    limit 100\n    """\n    r = l.run_cypher_query(sourcekey=\'ae46c2f7\', query=query)\n\n    # nodes and edges are transformed before being sent to the visualization \n    r_nodes = [\n        {\n            \'id\': n.data.properties.id, \n            \'data\': {\n                \'geo\': {}\n            }, \n            \'attributes\': {\n                \'layoutable\': True, \n                \'x\': 0, \'y\': 0\n            }\n        } \n        for n in r[\'nodes\']\n    ]\n    r_edges = [\n        {\n            \'id\': e.data.properties.id, \n            \'attributes\': {}\n        } \n        for e in r.edges\n    ]\n    \n    # visualization creation\n    v = l.create_visualization(\n        sourcekey=\'ae46c2f7\', \n        title="Test from API", \n        nodes=r_nodes, \n        edges=r_edges\n    )\n    # server-side auto layouting, in order to spread the nodes\n    l.patch_visualization(\n        sourcekey=\'ae46c2f7\', id=v.id, \n        do_layout=True,\n    )\n    \n    # visualization styles are reset\n    v.design.styles.node = []\n    v.design.styles.edge = []\n    l.patch_visualization(\n        sourcekey=\'ae46c2f7\', id=v.id,     \n        visualization={\'design\': dict(v.design)},\n        force_lock=True\n    )\n\n    # so that they can now be built anew\n    # see https://doc.linkurio.us/server-sdk/latest/apidoc/#api-Visualization-createVisualization\n    # and the links on INodeStyle and IEdgeStyle\n    v.design.styles.node = [\n        { ... }\n    ] \n    v.design.styles.edges = [\n        { ... }\n    ] \n    # design is updated in the visualization\n    # it must be transformed into a dict, as v is a Bunch (from tortilla),\n    # and it may causes all sorts of bad requests responses from Linkurious API\n    l.patch_visualization(\n        sourcekey=\'ae46c2f7\', id=v.id,     \n        visualization={\'design\': dict(v.design)},\n        force_lock=True\n    )\n    \n    # the same can be done for \n    # - visualization filters (v.filters)\n    # - visualization captions (v.nodeFields, v.edgeFields)\n    \n\n## Support\n\nThere is no guaranteed support available, but authors will try to keep up with issues \nand merge proposed solutions into the code base.\n\n## Project Status\nThis project is currently being developed by the [Openpolis Foundation](https://www.openpolis.it/openpolis-foundation/)\nand does only cover those parts of the Linkurious API that are needed in the Foundation\'s projects. \nShould more be needed, you can either ask to increase the coverage, or try to contribute, following instructions below.\n\n## Contributing\nIn order to contribute to this project:\n* verify that python 3.6+ is being used (or use [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv))\n* verify or install [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), to handle packages and dependencies in a leaner way, \n  with respect to pip and requirements\n* clone the project `git clone git@github.com:openpolis/linkurious.git` \n* install the dependencies in the virtualenv, with `poetry install`,\n  this will also install the dev dependencies\n* develop \n* create a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)\n* wait for the maintainers to review and eventually merge your pull request into the main repository\n\n### Testing\nAs this is a tiny utility wrapper around an already tested and quite simple package (tortilla), \nthere are no tests.\n\n## Authors\nGuglielmo Celata - guglielmo@openpolis.it\n\n## Licensing\nThis package is released under an MIT License, see details in the LICENSE.txt file.\n',
