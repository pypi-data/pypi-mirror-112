# brelpy

A Python package to communicate with the Brel [DD-7002B](https://www.brel-home.nl/en/smarthome-bi-directional/dd-7002b) 
and [DD-1554](https://www.brel-home.nl/en/smarthome-bi-directional/dd-1554) hubs. 
It allows you to control and read out [Brel](https://www.brel-home.nl/en) motors for blinds.

## Installation

The package can be installed by running:
```bash
pip3 install brelpy
```

Alternatively one can clone this repository and install by running `pip3 install .` to get 
the latest (possibly unreleased) version.

## Usage

A typical usage scenario looks like this:

```python
from brelpy import BrelHub


with BrelHub("<ip-of-your-hub>", "<key-of-your-hub>") as hub:
    for device in hub.devices:
        device.close()
```

The key can be found by multi-tapping the version indicator in the "me"-screen in the BrelHome app.
It has a form like "1ab2cd34-01ab-a1". It can also be provided in the `BREL_KEY` environment variable.
If it is not provided, you can still connect to the Hub but not perform any actions on the devices.

This package is open source software and has no affiliation with Brel.
