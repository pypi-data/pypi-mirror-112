# How to contribute to `text_formatter`

If you want to contribute, **thank you!** We really appreciate your intentions.

## Options to contribute

We recommend two ways: _using the issues and the forks._

### Using issues to contribute

If you are a newcomer to **text_formatter**, you can take a look to the [standing issues](http://github.com/diddileija/text_formatter/issues) to know 
where to help. Or maybe you know about a problem with the package, feel free to [create a new issue](http://github.com/diddileija/text_formatter/issues/new).

### Fork this repo

Another way to contribute is _forking this repository_. This will create a parallel copy of **text_formatter**. Then, make a 
[pull request](http://github.com/diddileija/text_formatter/pulls) on the original repo. **Maybe we can merge it!**

## Benefits of contributing

If you are contributing for the first time, we'll add _**your name**_ to `AUTHORS.txt`, which will be distributed
on the repo and the PyPI distribution!

## Code of Conduct

We use the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](http://github.com/diddileija/text_formatter/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to regulate the contributions. Please
