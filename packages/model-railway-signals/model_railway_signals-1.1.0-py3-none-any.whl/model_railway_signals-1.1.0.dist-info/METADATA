# model-railway-signalling
A model railway signalling library written in Python for the Raspberry Pi with a DCC control of Signals and Points and train 
detection via the GPIO ports on the Pi. For details of the "Public" API - scroll down the page

A simple interface to the Pi-SPROG-3 DCC Command station enables DCC control of the signals and points out on the layout. 
The GPIO interface allows external train detectors such as the BlockSignalling BOD2-NS to be connected in via opto-isolators.

All of the functions for creating and managing 'signals', 'points' and 'sections' have been developed as a Python Package 
to promote re-use across other layouts. This includes functions to support the interlocking of signals and points to enable 
fully prototypical signalling schemes to be developed. The signals and points opjects can be easily mapped to one or more DCC 
addresses in a manner that should be compatible with the majority of DCC signal/points decoders currently on the market. 
Track sensors can also be easily integrated (via the Raspberry Pi's GPIO interface) to enable full automatic control.

Most types of colour light signals (and ground position light signals) are supported. Semaphores are still on my TODO list.

Note that I have tried to make the package platform independent so you can use it to develop your own layout signalling schemes 
without a Raspberry Pi or the associated Pi-SPROG-3 DCC Command station (track sensors can be manually 'triggered' via the
layout schematic to ensure your code is doing what its supposed to do). Full logging is provided to help you develop/debug 
your own schemes - just set the log level to info to see what the package is doing 'under the hood'. And when you do enable
the DCC control aspects, a log level of DEBUG will show you the commands being sent out to the Pi-SPROG-3

Comments and suggestions welcome - but please be kind - the last time I coded anything it was in Ada96 ;)

## Installation
To install use:
<pre>
$ pip install model-railway-signals
</pre>
or alternatively:
<pre>
$ python3 -m pip install model-railway-signals 
</pre>
You may need to ensure you have the latest version of pip installed:
<pre>
$ pip install --upgrade pip
</pre>
or alternatively:
<pre>
$ python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
</pre>

## Using the package

To use the "public" functions for developing your own layout signalling system:
<code> from model_railway_signals import * </code>

Some examples are included in the repository: https://github.com/johnrm174/model-railway-signalling:

<pre>
'test_simple_example.py' - a simple example of how to use the "signals" and "points" modules to create a
           basic track schematic with interlocked signals/points. Also includes a simple DCC Mapping example
           (1 signal and 2 points) and an external track sensor to provide a "signal passed" event.

'test_approach_control.py' - an example of using automated "approach control" for junction signals. This 
           is where a signal displays a more restrictive aspect (either red or yellow) when a lower-speed 
           divergent route is set, forcing the approaching train to slow down and be prepared to stop. As 
           the train approaches, the signal is "released", allowing the train to proceed past the signal 
           and onto the divergent route. Examples of "Approach on Red" and "Approach on Yellow" are provided. 
           For "Approach on yellow", the signals behind will show the correct flashing yellow aspects.

'test_harman-signalist_sc1.py'- developed primarily for testing using the Harmann Signallist SC1 decoder. 
           Enables the various modes to be selected (includes programming of CVs) and then tested. I used 
           this decoder as it provided the most flexibility for some of my more complex signal types.
           Note that some of the modes will be similar/identical to other manufacturer's DCC signals.

'test_colour_light_signals.py'- developed primarily for testing, but it does provide an example of every 
           signal type and all the control features currently supported.

pulse_signal_passed_button (sig_id) - Pulses the signal passed button - use to indicate track sensor events

pulse_signal_release_button (sig_id) - Pulses the approach release button - use to indicate track sensor events

trigger_timed_signal - Sets the signal to DANGER and then cycles through the aspects back to PROCEED
                      - If a start delay >0 is specified then a 'sig_passed' callback event is generated
                      - when the signal is changed to DANGER - For each subsequent aspect change (all the
                      - way back to PROCEED) a 'sig_updated' callback event will be generated
  Mandatory Parameters:
      sig_id:int - The ID for the signal

      time_delay:int - Delay (in seconds) for cycling through the aspects (default=5)

set_approach_control - Puts the signal into "Approach Control" Mode where the signal will display a particular
                       aspect/state (either Red or Yellow) to approaching trains. As the Train approaches the
                       signal, the signal will be "released" to display the normal aspect. Normally used for
                       diverging routes which have a lower speed restriction to the main line. When a signal
                       is set in "approach control" mode then the signals behind will display the appropriate
                       aspects when updated (based on the signal ahead). for "Release on Red" these would be 
                       the normal aspects. For "Release on Yellow", assuming 4 aspect signals, the signals  
                       behind will display flashing single yellow and flashing double yellow 
  Mandatory Parameters:
      sig_id:int - The ID for the signal
  Optional Parameters:
      release_on_yellow:Bool - True = Yellow Approach aspect, False = Red Approach aspect (default=False)

clear_approach_control - This "releases" the signal to display the normal aspect and should be called when
                           a train is approaching the signal (so the signal clears in front of the driver)
                           Note that signals can also be released when the "release control button" is activated
                           (which is displayed just in front of the signal if specified at signal creation time)
  Mandatory Parameters:
      sig_id:int - The ID for the signal

    track_sensor_callback_type.sensor_triggered - The section has been toggled by the user

create_sensor - Creates a sensor object
  Mandatory Parameters:
      sensor_id:int - The ID to be used for the sensor 
      gpio_channel:int - The GPIO port number  to use for the sensor (not the physical pin number):
  Optional Parameters:
      sensor_timeout:float - The time period during which further triggers are ignored (default = 3 seconds)

sensor_active (sensor_id) - Returns the current state of the sensor (True/False)
</pre>

## DCC Address Mapping Functions

These functions provide the means to map the signals and points on the layout to the series of DCC 
commands needed to control them.

For the main signal aspects, either "Truth Table" or "Event Driven" mappings can be defined
The "Event Driven" mapping uses a single dcc command (address/state) to change the signal to 
the required aspect - as used by the TrainTech DCC signals. The "Truth Table" mapping provides
maximum flexibility for commanding DCC Signals as each "led" can either be controlled individually 
(i.e. Each LED of the signal is controlled via its own individual address) or via a "Truth Table" 
(where the displayed aspect will depend on the binary "code" written to 2 or more DCC addresses)
This has been successfully tested with the Harman Signallist SC1 DCC Decoder in various modes

"Truth Table" or "Event Driven" mappings can alos be defined for the Route indications supported by
the signal (feathers or theatre). If the signal has a subsidary associated with it, this is always
mapped to a single DCC address.

Not all signals/points that exist on the layout need to have a DCC Mapping configured - If no DCC mapping 
has been defined, then no DCC commands will be sent. This provides flexibility for including signals on the 
schematic which are "off scene" or for progressively "working up" the signalling scheme for a layout.

This provides a basic CBUS interface fpor communicating with the Pi-SPROG3 via the Raspberry Pi UART. It does not provide
a fully-functional interface for All DCC command and control functions - just the minimum set needed to support the driving
of signals and points via a selection of common DCC Accessory decoders.Basic CV Programming is also supported - primarily 
as an aid to testing, but for full decoder programming the recommendation is to use JRMI DecoderPro.
