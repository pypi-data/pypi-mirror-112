Scarf is a Python package that performs memory-efficient analysis of single-cell genomics data.

- Analyze atlas scale datasets on your laptop (tested with up to 4 million cells)
- Perform analysis of scATAC-Seq data (datasets with up to 700K cells with 1 million peaks tested) under 10 GB RAM
- Make parallel implementations of UMAP and tSNE (SG-tSNE) for quick cell embedding
- Perform hierarchical clustering that gives interpretable cluster relationships
- Sub-sample highly representative cells using state-of-the-art TopACeDo method
- Perform quick and accurate projections of cells from one dataset onto another or integrate multiple datasets.

Preprint describing Scarf is out on `Biorxiv`_

Install Scarf with::

    pip install scarf

**Known issues**:

`DataStore.run_tsne()` does not work on Windows and Mac: We currently ship a pre-compiled version SG-tSNE. This will be
fixed in future updates.

High memory consumption: If you are using a version of Scarf less than 0.7.0 and have dask version >2021.03.1
then you might face high memory consumption issues. The solution is to install dask==2021.03.1. The
latest version of Scarf automatically solves this issue.

Scarf was recently renamed to `scarf` from `scarf-toolkit` on PyPi. So if you previously installed using
`pip install scarf-toolkit` then you need to first uninstall using `pip uninstall scarf-toolkit`. Thereafter you can
install the recent version of Scarf using `pip install -U scarf`
