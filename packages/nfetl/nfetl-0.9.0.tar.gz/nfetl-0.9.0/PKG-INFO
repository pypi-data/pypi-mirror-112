        webscraping scripts.

        of this package from overwhelming the source web server. However, It is
        recommended users read the liscense before developing using this package and
        carefully consider how the planned implementation may impact source
        availability.
        
        ## Example

        from nfetl import DB
        import pandas as pd
        
        db: DB = DB()
        
        offense_df: pd.DataFrame = pd.read_sql("SELECT * FROM offense", db.connection)
        ```
