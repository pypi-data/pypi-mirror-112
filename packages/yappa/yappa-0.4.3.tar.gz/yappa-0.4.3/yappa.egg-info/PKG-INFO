# Simple serverless deploy of python web-apps 
[powered by Yandex Cloud]

Forget about setting up your own infrastructure, vps, network,
orchestrators, etc...

# Quickstart
1. Setup virtual env, create your app
2. create account at Yandex Cloud
3. use Yappa:
```shell
$ yappa setup
$ yappa deploy
 ```
...that's it!
# Deployment examples
Not just regular json API app could be deployed this way. Several types of
applications could be deployed with Yappa:
- json API (Flask, Django rest framework)
- regular Django app
- raw serverless function
- single page application 
- SPA + multiple API versions

Also looking for contributors %)
# Limitations
## frameworks support
At this point WSGI applications and raw functions are supported, 
tested on Flask and Django. ASGI applications (FastAPI, Starlette) will be added in the future
## Database connectivity
Only YandexDB is supported inside Yandex Cloud. Postgress will be added soon, see updates
## Headers and authorization
Please note that some request headers (like Authorization) are deleted before function is invoked 
# Troubleshooting
- grpcio on Apple M1   
There is a known issue with installing grpcio on M1 Macs, 
  installing with anaconda may help. Also look at
