        U-Net semantic segmentation for satellite imagery
        
        
        ## Description
        
        A set of classes and CLI tools for training a semantic segmentation model based
        on the U-Net architecture, using Tensorflow and Keras.
        
        This implementation is tuned specifically for satellite imagery and other
        geospatial raster data.
