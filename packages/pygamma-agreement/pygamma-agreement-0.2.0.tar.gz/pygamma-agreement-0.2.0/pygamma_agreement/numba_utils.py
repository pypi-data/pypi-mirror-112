    A numba njitted function that builds chunks of the cartesian product.
    It works by enumerating all possible combinations of the indices of
    each input sets, starting at the `current_tuple` element, and stopping
    after enumerating `start_idx - end_idx` elements.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sizes: np.ndarray of shape (N,)
        Cardinals of the sets
    current_tuple: np.ndarray of shape (N,)
        First cartesian combination to be enumerated

        Index of `current_tuple` in the global cartesian product
    end_idx
        Index of last cartesian combination to be enumerated (not included in
