Description: # Pastebin.com as a python file object
        
        A small python library with little dependencies to use [pastebin.com](pastebin.com) as file like objects
        Don't take it serious it's just a project to have some fun
        
        ## TODO
        
        * Add support for none buffered files
        * Split huge files to multiple pastes
        * Add encoding options
        * Add os function support (move, cpy, list)
        * Add async operations
        * Add missing tests
