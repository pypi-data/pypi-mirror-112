    This class creates a constant input stream of values which is used as input
    stream to the Siamese network path of the components. If the object is
    called it returns the constant input stream. This class can be used to add
    pre-defined non-trainable components to the model.

        variable: An input which is Keras-variable convertible, e.g. a numpy
            array. The variable is used as non-trainable constant Keras input
            stream.

    This layer is used to provide (non-)trainable components to the model. It

            component.
        initializer: Initializer for the `components` which is interpretable by
            Keras `initializers.get()` routine.
        regularizer: Regularizer for the `components` which is interpretable by
            Keras `regularizers.get()` routine.

            Keras `constraints.get()` routine.

    # Input shape
