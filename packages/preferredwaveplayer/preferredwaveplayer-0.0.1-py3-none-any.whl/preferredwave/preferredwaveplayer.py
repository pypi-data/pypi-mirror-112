#   Plays wav files using the methods I typically use to play waves.
#   Basically, I consider maintenance of code, ease of use, reliability
#   and so forth and use these methods below as they seem to be the best 
#   choices, considering the above factors.  See the README.md file 
#   at the project site for more on why I've chosen these methods.
#   
#   This module has no dependencies, other than what comes with Windows 10, 
#       the standard Linux kernel, MacOS 10.5 or later, and the 
#       Python Standard Library.
#      
#   Windows10 functions use the winmm.dll Windows Multimedia API calls 
#       using c function calls to play sounds.
#
#       See references:
#       “Programming Windows: the Definitive Guide to the WIN32 API, 
#           Chapter 22 Sound and Music Section III Advanced Topics 
#           ‘The MCI Command String Approach.’”

#   Linux uses ALSA which is part of the Linux kernel since version 2.6 and later
#   MacOS uses the afplay module which is present OS X 10.5 and later
