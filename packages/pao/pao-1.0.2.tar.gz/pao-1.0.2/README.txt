# PAO Overview

PAO is a Python-based package for Adversarial Optimization.  PAO extends
the modeling concepts in [Pyomo](https://github.com/Pyomo/pyomo) to enable
the expression and solution of multi-level optimization problems. The goal
of this package is to provide a general modeling and analysis capability,
and application exemplars serve to illustrate PAO's general capabilities.

This package was derived from the capabilities in **pyomo.bilevel** and
**pyomo.dualize**, which are now deprecated.

PAO is available under the BSD License, see the LICENSE.txt file.
