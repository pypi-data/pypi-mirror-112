"""Mu's runner launches a Python interpreter and feeds back the result
into a console that does not support colour.

If we try to "install" friendly-traceback in that console, SyntaxErrors
are properly captured but any runtime error simply disappear.

For this reason, we only provide two basic ways to start friendly-traceback
in this situation.
