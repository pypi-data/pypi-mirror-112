This is only necessary to do for PySpark users with versions 2.3.x and 2.4.x that have manually upgraded PyArrow to 0.15.0. The following can be added to conf/spark-env.sh to use the legacy Arrow IPC format:\n\n    ARROW_PRE_0_15_IPC_FORMAT=1`\n\nAnother way is to put the following on spark .config\n\n    .config("spark.sql.execution.arrow.pyspark.enabled", "true")\n    .config("spark.executorEnv.ARROW_PRE_0_15_IPC_FORMAT", "1")\n\n\nThis will instruct PyArrow >= 0.15.0 to use the legacy IPC format with the older Arrow Java that is in Spark 2.3.x and 2.4.x. Not setting this environment variable will lead to a similar error as described in [SPARK-29367](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-29367) when running pandas_udfs or toPandas() with Arrow enabled.\n\n\nSo all in all : either PyArrow needs to be at most in version 0.14.1 or if that cannot happen the above settings need to be be active.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n## Terminology\n\nLike any discipline, graphs come with their own set of nomenclature. \nThe following descriptions are intentionally simplified—more mathematically rigorous definitions can be found in any graph theory textbook.\n\n`Graph` \n\n    — A data structure G = (V, E) where V and E are a set of vertices/nodes and edges.\n\n`Vertex/Node` \n\n    — Represents a single entity such as a person or an object,\n\n`Edge` \n\n    — Represents a relationship between two vertices (e.g., are these two vertices friends on a social network?).\n\n`Directed Graph vs. Undirected Graph` \n\n    — Denotes whether the relationship represented by edges is symmetric or not \n\n`Weighted vs Unweighted Graph` \n\n     — In weighted graphs edges have a weight that could represent cost of traversing or a similarity score or a distance score\n\n     — In unweighted graphs edges have no weight and simply show connections . example: course prerequisites\n\n`Subgraph` \n\n    — A set of vertices and edges that are a subset of the full graph\'s vertices and edges.\n\n`Degree` \n    \n    — A vertex/node measurement quantifying the number of connected edges \n\n`Connected Component` \n\n    — A strongly connected subgraph, meaning that every vertex can reach the other vertices in the subgraph.\n\n`Shortest Path` \n    \n    — The lowest number of edges required to traverse between two specific vertices/nodes.\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n## Contributing\n\nFeel free to contribute by \n\n * Forking the repository to suggest a change, and/or\n * Starting an issue.',
