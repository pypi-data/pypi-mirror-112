# spectral-fit-viewer
This repository allows for the interactive display of spectral data to a local browser through utilizing the python library Bokeh within a command line application uniquely suited for Picarro. 

### For developing
The following instructions are valid for developers who use `pip` and `virtualenv`. Developers who prefer to use Conda will have to adapt the Makefile and other scripts to be suitable for that environment.

```
make develop
```

To run the SFV, first create a 'configscripts' directory to hold baseline and fit YAML files. 

```
mkdir configscripts 
```

As well, in the 'test' folder please create a 'logs' directory to hold logs from sessions and an 'rdf_data' directory to place your h5 files. 

```
cd tests
mkdir logs
mkdir rdf_data
```

Once you have your config scripts and data in the approperate location pip install the SFV through the command

```
pip install spectral_fit_viewer
```

and run the SFV with given file pathway by:
```
spectral_fit_viewer full -f configscripts/fit_script.yaml -b configscripts/baseline.yaml -d test/rdf_data -l test/logs
```

to get less logs in terminal an option is to run:
```
export LOLOGGER_SERVERLESS=1
```
