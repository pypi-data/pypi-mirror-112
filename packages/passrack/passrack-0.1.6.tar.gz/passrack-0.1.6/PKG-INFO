else, try the above steps again!

#### Setup

First you need to setup passrack for yourself

Procedure:

- Run `prack init` to initialize prack for your directory

There should be no output

- Run `prack config -ps <password>` to set your password for prack. It will ask you for your OLD PASSWORD
  - Now if you haven't configured your passowrd before, enter `fetcher` in the OLD PASSWORD INPUT which is the default password

**NOTE: THIS STORES YOUR PASSWORD FOR PASSRACK AND DOES NOT INDICATE A PASSWORD FOR PASSWORD MANAGEMENT**

- Now you are set up to use passrack

##### Encryption:

```
prack encrypt {password} {note(optional)}
```

For example:

```
prack encrypt 'Welcome982' -n google
```
Here the password `Welcome982` will be stored in encrypted format and stored in your device.

In the above example, 'google' is an ID that gives the encrypted data and identity.

You can even use `--note` instead of `-n` to add an ID

Giving an ID is completely optional, but highly recommended for every user. This helps you decrypt your messages easily

##### Decryption

There are two methods of decrypting/obtaining your passwords

###### SPECIFIC DECRYPTION

```
prack decrypt -n {note}
```

For example:

```
prack decrypt -n google
```

This gives you the stored password identified by `google` NOTE/ID.

###### MASS DECRYPTION

```
prack decryptf 
```

This gives you all of your stored passwords

```
prack decryptf
```

##### SUGGEST

```
prack suggest -n google
```

This gives a strong password suggestion, also gives you an option to save the password in pm with identifier note.

**NOTE: EVERY DECRYPTION METHOD NEEDS YOUR PassRack PASSWORD, HENCE IF YOU HAVE NOT SETUP PASSRACK, DECRYPTION WONT WORK**

##### CLEAR

`prack clear` cleans the data from data file

## Release Notes
