Springheel Changelog
====================

Version 7.0.2
-------------

Date: 2021-07-12

-  SHA-256 checksums are now calculated for all strips during the
   generation process, and are available through the site.json endpoints
   file.
-  The endpoints file also adds a list of “authors” for each category,
   and the Springheel version used to build the site. Its listing
   of chapter info is more useful as well.
-  “plain” theme now includes an experimental dark variant activated by
   `prefers-color-scheme:
   dark <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme>`__.
-  The code has been cleaned up and refactored in several places, mostly
   to reduce repetition.
-  Springheel now automatically adds a trailing slash to the end of
   ``base_url`` if it is missing.
-  Files referenced on the Extras page are now copied asynchronously.
-  Fixed some errors when comics didn’t have license URIs.
-  Fixed flow direction for chapter pages in right-to-left mode. This
   updates all themes and some templates.

Version 7.0.1
-------------

Date: 2021-06-29

-  Minor updates to documentation and file manifest.
-  Improved extra generation's file size calculator.

Version 7.0.0 “Chilchuck”
-------------------------

Date: 2021-06-21

It’s Springheel’s biggest release yet! I’ve changed or improved almost
every aspect of the program, so there’s almost too much to describe.

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Springheel now accepts metadata, transcript, and character files in
   JSON format. It expects the extensions “.meta.json” and
   “.transcript.json” for the former (respectively); character files can
   be named whatever you like, as they’re specified in the comic
   configuration. Set ``json_mode`` in ``conf.ini`` to True to try it
   out. The tutorial has detailed syntax examples. Note that generation
   may behave erratically if some input files are JSON and others are
   not; if you’re going to use JSON mode, make sure to convert all
   metadata, transcript, and character files to JSON format first.
-  A new command line script, ``springheel-addimg``, will automatically
   generate metadata files for strip images.
-  Springheel now automatically detects sizes for all images, removing
   the need to manually specify them in metadata. Dimensions are also
   stated in the output HTML, so page elements do not move or jitter as
   images load. This feature and ``springheel-addimg`` add
   `Pillow <https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/>`__ as a dependency.
-  You can now create “webtoon”-style comics with multiple image files
   per strip! Set ``mode`` to “webtoon” in both the comic ``.conf`` and
   the strip’s metadata, then add a list of image filenames to the
   latter as ``pieces:``, à la ``pieces: panel2.png, panel3.png``.
-  Springheel now contains proper documentation built with Sphinx. It’s
   the future! The rst files can be found in ``docsource`` when you
   download Springheel’s source code, but they’re mostly just automodule
   stuff, so I don’t know how useful they’ll be. I also built them with
   my own customized theme, so locally-produced output may vary. Note
   that you’ll need the numpydoc extension to build the docs from
   source.
-  Springheel can now generate “about” pages with long descriptions of
   comics, optionally with a subset of HTML. To use it, set ``about`` to
   True in ``conf.ini`` and define the about section in the relevant
   ``.conf`` file with “``about =``”. You can include line breaks by
   writing ``\n`` where needed. This feature adds a new dependency on
   `html-sanitizer <https://pypi.org/project/html-sanitizer>`__.
-  Some non-integer page numbers – decimals (like “6.5”) and double-page
   ranges (like “116–117”; en dashes and hyphens both work) – are now
   accepted.
-  Alt text on navigation arrows includes numbers, so assistive tech
   users can more quickly tell where they are actually going (without
   having to look at other areas of the page, identify relevant bits of
   long URLs, etc.).
-  Added a new “chapter view” – if chapters are enabled, you can
   generate pages for each chapter that show all that chapter’s strips
   (and the appropriate metadata) and allow navigation between chapters;
   as with individual comics, navigation will not appear if there is
   only one chapter. On sufficiently wide screens, two pages appear side
   by side, much like pages of a physical book.
-  The separator between stat line elements is now a translatable
   template string, so you can edit it locally if you want a different
   one.
-  Allow setting raw HTML copyright/license statements with
   ``license_html`` in .conf files.
-  The date formatting string is now editable in strings.json. Caveats:
   for compatibility, there is no single string passed directly to
   strftime. Instead, the values of ``strf_format`` (default:
   “%Y{y}%m{m}%d{d}”) and ``date_format`` (list of 3 strings, can be "")
   are combined. Warning: because of the variety of different areas of
   the code where dates are used, substantial changes to ``strf_format``
   may cause unpredictable problems during build.
-  The extras page now indicates the size of downloadable files in
   bytes, kibibytes, or mebibytes.
-  You can now manually specify slugs. For categories, add a line like
   ``slug = desired-slug`` to the ``.conf`` file. For strips, add
   ``title_slug: desired-slug`` to the ``.meta`` file. (Strip slugs are
   only used in image rename patterns.) This is especially useful for
   non-ASCII languages that get odd output from the existing slug
   system.
-  Added rudimentary support for OpenGraph and Twitter Card tags.
-  If a comic is based on an existing work, you can now add a link to
   the source in its ``.meta`` file à la
   ``source: https://example.com``, and it will appear in the statline.
-  Springheel’s command-line messages are now translatable with gettext,
   making the program easier to use in other languages.
-  Type hints have been added to all functions.

New Default Themes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  “elemental” subthemes “electricity”, “ice”, “wood”, and “metal”.
-  “staples”
-  “meikai”
-  “berryheart”
-  “blacktea”

Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  File copying and similar features are now performed asynchronously,
   so they should be considerably faster. This increases the minimum
   Python version required to 3.7.
-  Previous/next buttons are no longer displayed if there is only one
   more strip in that direction (i.e., first/previous or next/last have
   the same value), to avoid having multiple buttons going to the same
   page.
-  If only one strip (or chapter) exists in a category, navigation is
   not generated at all.
-  Figure captions are no longer displayed if nothing has been set for
   them. (Of course actual alt text is present for the images
   themselves.)
-  “Permalink” has been added to the stat line.
-  Chapters no longer must have titles (this was intended to be the case
   already, but I forgot).
-  Transcript parsing is much neater and cleaner, and accepts more line
   endings.
-  *Lots* of fixes to make the code faster and cleaner.
-  Tuned up all themes and templates significantly. They are cleaner and
   more accessible all around.
-  The “twothousand” theme in particular has been almost entirely
   rewritten. It should be less ugly and more faithful to the era it
   evokes.
-  Category/chapter/page information has been moved to the stat line
   (“Posted by Jane Smith on such-and-such date”), and links to the
   chapter-view page if applicable.
-  Copyright footer information is more detailed, especially when strips
   in the same category have different authors.
-  Copyright years are now listed as a range from the original posting
   date to the current year as of site-generation time.
-  Meta lines include links to transcript files, instead of just
   metadata files.
-  Springheel now fails to build if a page without a chapter specified
   is in a category that *is* divided into chapters. (At present,
   Springheel is not designed to allow this.)
-  Post dates are now displayed in archives.
-  On Japanese sites, dates now appear formatted like
   “[year]年[month]月[day]日”, as this isn’t substantially different
   from ISO 8601.
-  Table of contents generation has been expanded to include
   non-chaptered comics.
-  The scrollto preference has been removed, as it was causing issues
   with other necessary features.
-  Comics without transcripts no longer display a message to that effect
   on generated pages. I reasoned that it was confusing to have a
   “transcript” heading if there was in fact no transcript present. The
   JSON endpoints file will still contain
   ``transcript_c: "<p>The author has not provided a transcript for this comic.</p>"``
   (or the equivalent in the site language) for consistency.
-  In the same vein, comics without commentary do not display the “no
   commentary” message and have the “Commentary” heading switched out
   for “Metadata”.
-  The links to metadata and transcript files now indicate the
   approximate type of file they are. In default mode, this will be
   “YAML” for metadata and “TXT” for transcripts, and in JSON mode,
   “JSON” for both.
-  Made it less annoying to add new fields to ``strings.json``.
-  Logging has been improved and now defaults to off. To enable it, just
   add ``--logging`` as an argument to ``springheel-build``.
-  Skip-navigation links are now always visible in all themes, rather
   than being visually hidden until activated.
-  The “home” link in top navigation has been removed, and the header
   image is now a link to the home page.

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

-  Finally switched the meanings of “header” and “banner” in
   configuration files and templates, and renamed the
   ``banner_filename`` option in ``conf.ini`` to ``header_filename``.
   This is a backwards-incompatible change. (I originally got them the
   wrong way around by mistake, and was waiting for a major version to
   fix it.)
-  Navigation goes only to *existent* pages, to avoid 404 errors from
   numbering gaps.
-  If multiple comics on a multi-theme site use the same theme, that
   theme is no longer relentlessly duplicated by the stylesheet
   concatenation process.
-  Comics are now sorted consistently on index and archive pages.
-  Chapter titles no longer contain trailing newlines.
-  If a comic has multiple authors, this is reflected in the JSON Feed.
-  Characters are attributed to the correct comics in the site JSON
   endpoints file.
-  Commentaries no longer contain empty ``<p>`` elements.

No matter how many times the Sun rises or the Moon sets, like the
lodestar above that guides us, may the winds of fortune ever blow your
way.

Version 6.0.3
-------------

Date: 2020-07-26

-  Fixed a bug that kept headers and banners from copying to output
   under some circumstances.

Version 6.0.2
-------------

Date: 2020-07-18

-  Removing some accidental JSON debug output from building. ^_^;;

Version 6.0.1
-------------

Date: 2020-07-18

-  Replaced awesome-slugify with
   `python-slugify <https://pypi.org/project/python-slugify/>`__, as the
   former is no longer actively developed.
-  Minor updates to JSON Feed generation to comply with version 1.1 of
   the spec.

Version 6.0.0 “Ukyou”
---------------------

Date: 2020-05-27

-  Added new themes “fluff”, “crystal”, and “elemental” (which is
   configurable, like “seasonal”).
-  Added progress bars for time-consuming parts of site generation, like
   finding images and creating tag index pages. This feature adds
   `tdqm <https://pypi.org/project/tqdm/>`__ as a dependency.
-  Added rudimentary `JSON Feed <https://jsonfeed.org/>`__ support. I
   hacked this together myself based on existing JSON endpoint bits; it
   validates, but should be considered experimental.
-  Added feature to generate tables of contents on archive pages if the
   comic has chapters.
-  Improvements to the “book”, “fairy”, “gothic”, and “city” themes.
-  Optimized some graphics slightly. There should be little or no visual
   difference.
-  Cut some unneeded mixin imports from the theme SCSS files.
-  Fixed an error in the default conf.ini – ``scrollto`` was mistakenly
   listed as ``skipto`` and so did not work.
-  Fixed several bugs in non-chaptered comic archives.
-  Changed the recommended alternate value of ``scrollto`` from “comic”
   to “topbox” so that above-strip navigation can still be accessed.
   “comic” is still accepted as a valid value for ``scrollto``.
-  Added ``scrollto`` to archive links as well.
-  Allow disabling ``scrollto`` by setting it to ``False``.
-  Added classes and I.D.s to some elements that did not have them.
-  Added social button for Mastodon.
-  RSS feed generation bugfixes: less hacky output selection and comment
   creation, and strips with a more recent date will appear closer to
   the top of the XML file.
-  Cleaned up social media icon code and markup a bit.
-  Removed trailing spaces that were accidentally inserted after speaker
   identifiers in transcripts.
-  Many improvements to the HOWTO.md tutorial file.
-  Adding page URL as an argument to ``format()`` when generating pages.
   If you want to add something like a “share” button to your page
   templates (per the “Extending Springheel Sites” section of HOWTO.md),
   you can use ``{url}`` in place of a static permalink. Springheel will
   now replace that with the page’s URL.
-  The default alt text that appears when ``alt`` is unset is now more
   informative.
-  Page numbering now sensibly allows for page number 0. (It previously
   started from 1.) This allows for cover pages and the like without
   creating confusing constructions like “Page #2 ‘Page 1’”.
-  If they exist, some non-strip assets (e.g. stylesheets, site
   graphics, navigation arrows) are no longer rewritten when building,
   to avoid them being copied and re-copied over and over. Delete
   ``output/assets`` and ``output/arrows`` if you do want to overwrite
   these files.

Version 5.2.4
-------------

Date: 2019-12-29

-  Alt text for comic pages is now a translated string.
-  Extra images now have alt text, allowing screen readers on some
   platforms to announce their captions properly.

Version 5.2.3
-------------

Date: 2019-12-29

-  Finally accepted that my paltry attempt to support favicons was in
   error. Users who want to add favicons should edit their site’s local
   templates (the old/bad favicon code has been replaced with a comment
   indicating where to insert the output from a dedicated favicon
   generator) and manually copy the appropriate files into ``output``.
-  Fixed a couple of minor HTML errors in templates (mostly extra
   whitespace and single-quoted elements) and the processing of same.

Version 5.2.2
-------------

Date: 2019-12-16

-  Improved metadata parsing a bit.
-  Added missing docstrings.
-  Fixed some quirks in page-footer copyright statements.
-  Cleaned up some unused functions.
-  Updated HOWTO.md

Version 5.2.1
-------------

Date: 2019-10-31

-  Removed the ``langcodes`` dependency. Multi-language site linking
   should work the same as before, if not better.
-  Added display of the original language code as a fallback if
   Springheel doesn’t know the proper name for a language during
   multi-language site linking.

Version 5.2.0 “Bossun”
----------------------

Date: 2019-10-27

-  Made it possible to insert links to your Springheel site in other
   languages in the site footer, using the new ``multilang`` config
   option. Notably, this adds ``langcodes`` as a dependency (to display
   the language names correctly).
-  Added functionality to generate a JSON file (``output/site.json``)
   with detailed information about the site, including URL endpoints.
   This should theoretically make it easier to extend Springheel sites
   with other programs.
-  Fixed an error in social icon spacing. (Re-init any existing site
   templates.)
-  Updated HOWTO.md

Version 5.1.0 “Senku”
---------------------

Date: 2019-10-23

-  Added a configuration option for skip links and comic navigation to
   scroll directly to the comic image, instead of to the page title.
-  Fixed an error that was preventing sites’ local ``strings.json``
   files from being used.
-  Completely rewrote comic navigation.
-  Started work on a Spanish translation. It’s incomplete and likely
   weird in many places; I don’t actually speak Spanish. (The
   translation is based entirely on poking around on Spanish webcomic
   sites to see how they render the common terms, double-checking with
   several dictionaries.)
-  Started a French translation in the same way, although I’m even less
   sure of this one’s accuracy.
-  Removed references to GitHub from ``setup.py`` and templates in
   protest of their contract with ICE.

Version 5.0.3
-------------

Date: 2019-10-10

-  Fixed a major bug where comics on multi-comic sites were added to the
   wrong chapters.
-  Corrected the error message that appears if “status” is unset.

Version 5.0.2
-------------

Date: 2019-10-2

-  Fixed a bug where tag page results weren’t being sorted correctly.
-  Archive page titles for single-comic sites are now translatable.
-  Fixed an error where colons couldn’t be used in some metadata fields.
-  Removed the long-unnecessary language prompt when running
   ``springheel-init``.
-  Lots of improvements to all themes. (Make sure to re-run
   ``springheel-init`` to update your stylesheets)

Version 5.0.1
-------------

Date: 2019-09-19

-  Started escaping most things that will appear as HTML.

Version 5.0.0 “Azumane”
-----------------------

Date: 2019-09-3

-  Added proper tagging system.
-  Added option for zero-padding page numbers.
-  Cleared out some unused stuff from archive and navigation generation
   + the default conf.ini
-  Fixed some issues with image renaming.
-  Fixed error where chaptered works sometimes appeared twice on archive
   pages.
-  Started naming major/minor versions [STRIKEOUT:after hot anime dudes]

Version 4.1.0
-------------

Date: 2019-07-23

-  Springheel now generates XML site maps of comic sites.
-  Cleaned up logging a bit.

Version 4.0.0
-------------

Date: 2019-06-20

-  Added new themes “revolution”, “fairy”, “sysadmin”, and “might”.
-  Separated traits from descriptions on character pages.
-  Fixed major error where a multi-comic site wouldn’t generate if some
   comics had a characters file and some didn’t.
-  Fixed bug where slugs were not URL-safe.
-  Fixed bug where the archive page’s main heading wasn’t getting
   translated.
-  Fixed bug where extras pages used a comic’s title and banner, instead
   of the sitewide ones.
-  Slight improvements to “seasonal” and “showtime” themes.

Version 3.0.3
-------------

Date: 2019-06-15

-  Fixed a very stupid copy+paste error that caused public domain comics
   to be described as published from a U.R.L. (instead of their
   respective country).

Version 3.0.2
-------------

Date: 2019-06-15

-  Did a better job fixing the character bug from the previous version.
-  Fixed an error where non-transcribed comics wouldn’t generate on
   Windows.
-  Fiddled with the markdown in HOWTO.md because it was displaying
   strangely in some programs.

Version 3.0.1
-------------

Date: 2019-05-25

-  Fixed a bug where archives weren’t generating correctly for
   non-chaptered comics.
-  Fixed a bug where the ordering of character attributes changed
   randomly every time the page was regenerated.
-  Updated some information in the default conf.ini file.

Version 3.0.0
-------------

Date: 2019-05-10

-  Added extras page functionality
-  Added new theme “showtime”
-  Corrected ``<title>`` elements for character pages
-  Improved logging

Version 2.0.0
-------------

Date: 2019-02-9

-  Condensed template files into one
-  Improved accessibility
-  Updated translations

Version 1.0.2
-------------

Date: 2019-01-25

-  Fixed a bug where archives couldn’t be generated for multi-comic
   sites.

Version 1.0.1
-------------

Date: 2019-01-25

-  Fixed the parts of the readme that said arrow was a dependency (it
   isn’t).
-  Fixed a bug where .sass-cache was getting installed as if it were a
   theme.

Version 1.0.0
-------------

Date: 2019-01-24

- First public release!
-  Streamlined config files.
-  Tidied up all stylesheets and templates.
-  Added some more translation strings.
-  Refactored a whole lot of code and made it neater.
-  Fixed miscellaneous bugs.
-  Added new themes “rock” and “western”.
-  Added better arrows for some themes.
