Springheel Documentation
========================

Welcome to Springheel's documentation!

Springheel is a static site generator for webcomics.

Whether it's static site generators or Wordpress plugins, most existing software is geared towards blogs, not comics. Adapting them to work with comics is kludgey and fragile, and unnecessarily exposes you to security problems. But why force a square peg into a round hole when round pegs are easy enough to make? With that in mind I created Springheel. (The name comes from Spring-heel Jack, for the "English monster" naming scheme that many static generators keep to.)

Keep in mind that I'm self-taught (`obligatory xkcd <http://www.xkcd.com/1513/>`_) and maybe don't look too closely at the actual code, although it's getting better.
