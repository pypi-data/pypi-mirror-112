Description:  maop- MAth OPerations is a simple python package that takes to numbers and either add, subtracts, multiply or divide them.
        
         USAGE:
        
         to install:
        
         pip install maop
        
         to add:
        
         import maop
        
        
         maop.add(4, 5) - takes two numbers and adds them, same goes for other operations.
        
        
         NOTE- PLEASE READ THIS:
        
         In this package, there are two types of divisions: divide1 and divide2
        
         divide1 takes two numbers and returns the EXACT answer of the division.
         example:
         import maop
        
         maop.divide1(4, 5)
        
         output: 0.8 - this is the exact answer to 4 divided by 5
        
        divide2 takes two numbers and DOES NOT return the EXACT answer, instead it returns either the integer or a float numbers
        example:
        import maop
        
        maop.divide2(4, 5)
        
        output: 0- this is ONLY THE integer taken from the EXACT answer from 4 divided by 5.
        
        Thanks
