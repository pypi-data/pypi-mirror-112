.. _why:

============
Why ProPlot?
============

Matplotlib is an extremely powerful plotting package used
by academics, engineers, and data scientists far and wide. However,
matplotlib can be cumbersome or repetitive for users who...

* Make very complex figures with multiple subplots.
* Want to finely tune their figure annotations and aesthetics.
* Need to make new figures nearly every day.

ProPlot's core mission is to provide a smoother plotting experience
for matplotlib's heaviest users. We accomplish this by *expanding upon*
matplotlib's object-oriented interface. ProPlot makes changes that would be
hard to justify or difficult to incorporate into matplotlib itself, owing
to differing design choices and backwards compatibility considerations.

This page enumerates these changes and explains how they
address the limitations of matplotlib's default interface.

..
   This page is not comprehensive --
   see the User Guide for a comprehensive overview
   with worked examples.

..
   To start using these new features, see
   see :ref:`Usage overview` and the User Guide.

.. _why_less_typing:

Less typing, more plotting
==========================

.. rubric:: Limitation

Matplotlib users often need to change lots of plot settings all at once. With
the default interface, this requires calling a series of one-liner setter methods.

This workflow is quite verbose -- it tends to require "boilerplate code" that
gets copied and pasted a hundred times. It can also be confusing -- it is
often unclear whether properties are applied from an `~matplotlib.axes.Axes`
setter (e.g. `~matplotlib.axes.Axes.set_xlabel` and
`~matplotlib.axes.Axes.set_xticks`), an `~matplotlib.axis.XAxis` or
`~matplotlib.axis.YAxis` setter (e.g.
`~matplotlib.axis.Axis.set_major_locator` and
`~matplotlib.axis.Axis.set_major_formatter`), a `~matplotlib.spines.Spine`
setter (e.g. `~matplotlib.spines.Spine.set_bounds`), or a "bulk" property
setter (e.g. `~matplotlib.axes.Axes.tick_params`), or whether one must dig
into the figure architecture and apply settings to several different objects.
While this is in the spirit of object-oriented design, it seems like there
should be a more unified, straightforward way to change settings for
day-to-day matplotlib usage.

..
   This is perhaps one reason why many users prefer the `~matplotlib.pyplot`
   interface to the object-oriented interface (see :ref:`Using ProPlot`).

.. rubric:: Solution

ProPlot introduces the `~proplot.axes.Axes.format` method to resolve this.
Think of this as an expanded and thoroughly documented version of the
`matplotlib.artist.Artist.update` method.
`~proplot.axes.Axes.format` can modify things like axis labels and titles and
update existing axes with new :ref:`"rc" settings <why_rc>`. It also integrates
with various :ref:`constructor functions <why_constructor>` to help keep things
succinct. Further, :ref:`subplot containers <ug_container>` can be used to
invoke `~proplot.axes.Axes.format` on several subplots at once.

Together, these features significantly reduce the amount of code needed to create
highly customized figures. As an example, it is trivial to see that...

.. code-block:: python

   import proplot as pplt
   fig, axs = pplt.subplots(ncols=2)
   axs.format(linewidth=1, color='gray')
   axs.format(xlim=(0, 100), xticks=10, xtickminor=True, xlabel='foo', ylabel='bar')

is much more succinct than...

.. code-block:: python

   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   import matplotlib.ticker as mticker
   import matplotlib as mpl
   with mpl.rc_context(rc={'axes.linewidth': 1, 'axes.color': 'gray'}):
       fig, axs = plt.subplots(ncols=2, sharey=True)
       axs[0].set_ylabel('bar', color='gray')
       for ax in axs:
           ax.set_xlim(0, 100)
           ax.xaxis.set_major_locator(mticker.MultipleLocator(10))
           ax.tick_params(width=1, color='gray', labelcolor='gray')
           ax.tick_params(axis='x', which='minor', bottom=True)
           ax.set_xlabel('foo', color='gray')

.. _why_constructor:

Class constructor functions
===========================

.. rubric:: Limitation

Matplotlib and `cartopy`_ define several classes with verbose names like
`~matplotlib.ticker.MultipleLocator`, `~matplotlib.ticker.FormatStrFormatter`,
and `~cartopy.crs.LambertAzimuthalEqualArea`. They also keep them out of
the top-level package namespace. Since plotting code has a half life of about 30
seconds, typing out these extra class names and import statements can be a major drag.

Parts of matplotlib's interface were actually designed with this in mind.
`Backend classes <https://matplotlib.org/faq/usage_faq.html#what-is-a-backend>`__,
`native axes projections <https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/projections_api.html>`__,
`axis scales <https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/scales/scales.html>`__,
`box styles <https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.patches.FancyBboxPatch.html>`__,
`arrow styles <https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.patches.FancyArrowPatch.html>`__,
and `arc styles <https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.patches.ConnectionStyle.html>`__
are referenced with "registered" string names,
as are `basemap projections <https://matplotlib.org/basemap/users/mapsetup.html>`__.
So, why not "register" everything else?

.. rubric:: Solution

In ProPlot, tick locators, tick formatters, axis scales, `cartopy`_ projections, colormaps,
and property cyclers are all "registered". ProPlot does this by defining *constructor
functions* and passing various keyword arguments through these functions. This may seem
"unpythonic" but it is absolutely invaluable for writing plotting code.

The constructor functions also accept flexible inputs. For example, a scalar passed
to `~proplot.constructor.Locator` returns a `~matplotlib.ticker.MultipleLocator`, a
lists of strings passed to `~proplot.constructor.Formatter` returns a
`~matplotlib.ticker.FixedFormatter`, and `~proplot.constructor.Colormap`
and `~proplot.constructor.Cycle` accept colormap names, individual colors, and lists
of colors. Passing the relevant class instance to a constructor function simply
returns the instance.

See the user guide sections on :ref:`Cartesian plots <ug_cartesian>`,
:ref:`colormaps <ug_cmaps>`, and :ref:`color cycles <ug_cycles>` for details. The below
table lists the constructor functions and the keyword arguments that use them.

================================  ============================================================  =============================================================  =================================================================================================================================================================================================

Note that `~matplotlib.axes.Axes.set_xscale` and `~matplotlib.axes.Axes.set_yscale` now
accept instances of `~matplotlib.scale.ScaleBase` thanks to a monkey patch applied by
ProPlot.

.. _why_spacing:

Automatic dimensions and spacing
================================

.. rubric:: Limitation

Matplotlib plots tend to require lots of "tweaking" when you have more than one subplot
in the figure. This is partly because you must specify the physical dimensions of the
figure, despite the fact that...

#. The *subplot* aspect ratio is generally more relevant than the figure
   aspect ratio. An aspect ratio of ``1`` is desirable for most plots, and
   the aspect ratio must be held fixed for
   :ref:`geographic and polar <ug_proj>` projections and most
   `~matplotlib.axes.Axes.imshow` plots.
#. The physical width and height of the *subplot* controls the "evident"
   thickness of text, lines, and other content plotted inside the subplot.
   The effect of the figure size on this "evident" thickness depends on the
   number of subplot tiles in the figure.

Also, while matplotlib's `tight layout algorithm
<https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/intermediate/tight_layout_guide.html>`__
helps to avoid tweaking the *spacing*, the algorithm cannot apply different amounts of
spacing between different subplot row and column boundaries.

.. rubric:: Solution

In ProPlot, you can specify the physical dimensions of a *reference subplot*
instead of the figure by passing `refwidth`, `refheight`, and/or `refaspect` to
`~proplot.figure.Figure`. The default behavior is ``refaspect=1`` and
``refwidth=2`` (inches). If the `aspect ratio mode
<https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/subplots_axes_and_figures/axis_equal_demo.html>`__
for the reference subplot is set to ``'equal'``, as with
:ref:`geographic and polar <ug_proj>` plots and `~matplotlib.axes.Axes.imshow` plots,
the *imposed* aspect ratio will be used instead.

The width or height of the *figure* can also be constrained independently with the
`figwidth` and `figheight` parameters. If only one is specified, the other will be
adjusted to preserve subplot aspect ratios. You can select a `figwidth` and/or
`figheight` suitable for submission to :ref:`various publications <journal_table>`
using the `journal` parameter.

ProPlot also uses its own "tight layout" algorithm to automatically
determine the `left`, `right`, `bottom`, `top`, `wspace`, and `hspace`
`~matplotlib.gridspec.GridSpec` parameters. This algorithm has
the following advantages:

* Spacing between rows and columns is now *variable* thanks to the
  `~proplot.gridspec.GridSpec` subclass. This is critical for putting
  :ref:`colorbars and legends <ug_cbars_legends>` or
  :ref:`axes panels <ug_insets_panels>` outside of subplots
  without "stealing space" from the parent subplot.
* The "tight layout" algorithm is fairly simple because figures are
  restricted to have just *one* `~proplot.gridspec.GridSpec`. This is done
  by requiring users to draw all of their subplots at once with
  `~proplot.ui.subplots` (although in a :pr:`future version <50>`,
  there will be a ``proplot.figure`` function that allows users to add
  subplots one-by-one while retaining the single-gridspec restriction).

See the :ref:`user guide <ug_subplots>` for details.

..
   #. The `~proplot.gridspec.GridSpec` spacing parameters are specified in
   physical units instead of figure-relative units.

..
   The `~matplotlib.gridspec.GridSpec` class is useful for creating figures
   with complex subplot geometry.

..
   Users want to control axes positions with gridspecs.

..
   * Matplotlib permits arbitrarily many `~matplotlib.gridspec.GridSpec`\ s
   per figure. This greatly complicates the tight layout algorithm for
   little evident gain.

..
   ProPlot introduces a marginal limitation (see discussion in :pr:`50`) but
   *considerably* simplifies the tight layout algorithm.


.. _why_redundant:

Working with multiple subplots
==============================

.. rubric:: Limitation

For many matplotlib users, figures with one subplot are a rarity. These users
need multiple subplots to communicate complex ideas. Unfortunately, the path of
least resistance often leads to *redundant* figure elements when drawing
multiple subplots, namely...

* Repeated axis tick labels.
* Repeated axis labels.
* Repeated colorbars.
* Repeated legends.

These sorts of redundancies are very common even in publications, where they waste
valuable page space. It is also generally necessary to add "a-b-c" labels to
figures with multiple subplots before submitting them to publications, but
matplotlib has no built-in way of doing this.

.. rubric:: Solution

ProPlot makes it easier to work with multiple subplots and create clear, concise
figures.

* Axis tick labels and axis labels are :ref:`shared between subplots <ug_share>`
  in the same row or column by default. This is controlled by the `sharex`, `sharey`,
  `spanx`, and `spany` `~proplot.ui.subplots` keyword args.
* The new `proplot.figure.Figure.colorbar` and `proplot.figure.Figure.legend` methods
  can be used to draw colorbars and legends intended to reference more than one
  subplot in arbitrary contiguous rows and columns. See the
  :ref:`next section <why_colorbars_legends>` for details.
* :ref:`A-b-c labels <ug_abc>` can be easily added to subplots using the :rcraw:`abc`
  and :rcraw:`abc.style` settings -- for example, using
  ``axs.format(abc=True, abcstyle='A.')``. This is possible because
  `~proplot.ui.subplots` assigns a unique `~proplot.axes.Axes.number` to every axes.


.. _why_colorbars_legends:

Simpler colorbars and legends
=============================

.. rubric:: Limitation

In matplotlib, it can be difficult to draw `~matplotlib.figure.Figure.legend`\ s
along the outside of subplots. Generally, you need to position the legend
manually and tweak the spacing to make *room* for the legend.

Also, `~matplotlib.figure.Figure.colorbar`\ s drawn along the outside of subplots
with e.g. ``fig.colorbar(..., ax=ax)`` need to "steal" space from the parent subplot.
This can cause asymmetry in figures with more than one subplot. It is also generally
difficult to draw "inset" colorbars in matplotlib.

..
   And since colorbar widths are specified in *axes relative* coordinates,
   they often look "too skinny" or "too fat" after the first draw.

..
   The matplotlib example for `~matplotlib.figure.Figure` legends is `not pretty
   <https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/text_labels_and_annotations/figlegend_demo.html>`__.

..
   Drawing colorbars and legends is pretty clumsy in matplotlib -- especially
   when trying to draw them outside of the figure. They can be too narrow,
   too wide, and mess up your subplot aspect ratios.

.. rubric:: Solution

ProPlot includes a simple framework for drawing colorbars and legends
that reference :ref:`individual subplots <ug_cbars_axes>` and
:ref:`multiple contiguous subplots <ug_cbars_figure>`.

* To draw a colorbar or legend on the outside of a specific subplot, pass an
  "outer" location (e.g. ``loc='l'`` or ``loc='left'``)
  to `proplot.axes.Axes.colorbar` or `proplot.axes.Axes.legend`.
* To draw a colorbar or legend on the inside of a specific subplot, pass an
  "inner" location (e.g. ``loc='ur'`` or ``loc='upper right'``)
  to `proplot.axes.Axes.colorbar` or `proplot.axes.Axes.legend`.
* To draw a colorbar or legend along the edge of the figure, use
  `proplot.figure.Figure.colorbar` and `proplot.figure.Figure.legend`.
  The `col`, `row`, and `span` keyword args control which
  `~matplotlib.gridspec.GridSpec` rows and columns are spanned by the
  colorbar or legend.

Since `~proplot.gridspec.GridSpec` permits variable spacing between subplot
rows and columns, "outer" colorbars and legends do not alter subplot
spacing or add whitespace. This is critical e.g. if you have a
colorbar between columns 1 and 2 but nothing between columns 2 and 3.
Also, `~proplot.figure.Figure` and `~proplot.axes.Axes` colorbar widths are
now specified in *physical* units rather than relative units, which makes
colorbar thickness independent of subplot size and easier to get just right.

There are also several useful new :ref:`colorbar <ug_cbars>` and
:ref:`legend <ug_legends>` features described in the user guide.


.. _why_plotting:

Improved plotting methods
=========================

.. rubric:: Limitation

A few common plotting tasks take a lot of work using matplotlib alone. The `seaborn`_,
`xarray`_, and `pandas`_ packages offer improvements, but it would be nice to
have this functionality built right into matplotlib's interface.

..
   Matplotlib also has some finicky plotting issues
   that normally requires
..
   For example, when you pass coordinate *centers* to `~matplotlib.axes.Axes.pcolor`
   and `~matplotlib.axes.Axes.pcolormesh`, they are interpreted as *edges* and the
   last column and row of your data matrix is ignored. Also, to add labels to
   `~matplotlib.axes.Axes.contour` and `~matplotlib.axes.Axes.contourf`, you need
   to call a dedicated `~matplotlib.axes.Axes.clabel` method instead of just using
   a keyword argument.

.. rubric:: Solution

ProPlot adds various `seaborn`_, `xarray`_, and `pandas`_ features to the
`~proplot.axes.Axes` plotting methods along with several additional features
designed to make your life easier.

The following features are relevant for "1D" plotting methods like
`~matplotlib.axes.Axes.plot` and `~matplotlib.axes.Axes.scatter`:

* The new `~proplot.axes.Axes.parametric` method draws
  :ref:`parametric lines <ug_parametric>`, where the parametric coordinate is
  denoted with colormap colors rather than text annotations.
* The `~matplotlib.axes.Axes.bar` and `~matplotlib.axes.Axes.barh` methods accept
  2D arrays and can :ref:`stack or group <ug_bar>` successive columns. Similarly,
  the new `~proplot.axes.Axes.area` and `~proplot.axes.Axes.areax` methods
  (aliases for `~matplotlib.axes.Axes.fill_between` and
  `~matplotlib.axes.Axes.fill_betweenx`) also accept 2D arrays
  and can :ref:`stack or overlay <ug_bar>` successive columns.
* The `~matplotlib.axes.Axes.bar`, `~matplotlib.axes.Axes.barh`,
  `~matplotlib.axes.Axes.vlines`, `~matplotlib.axes.Axes.hlines`,
  `~proplot.axes.Axes.area`, and `~proplot.axes.Axes.areax` commands
  all accept a `negpos` keyword argument that can be used to assign
  "negative" and "positive" colors to different regions.
* You can now :ref:`add error bars or error shading <ug_errorbars>`
  to `~matplotlib.axes.Axes.bar`, `~matplotlib.axes.Axes.barh`, and
  `~matplotlib.axes.Axes.plot` plots by passing keyword arguments to
  these functions. You do not have to work with the
  `~matplotlib.axes.Axes.errorbar` method separately.
* All :ref:`1D plotting methods <ug_1dplots>` accept a
  `cycle` :ref:`keyword argument <ug_apply_cycle>`
  interpreted by `~proplot.constructor.Cycle` and
  `colorbar` and `legend` :ref:`keyword arguments <ug_cbars_axes>`
  for drawing colorbars and legends at the specified location.

The following features are relevant for "2D" plotting methods like
`~matplotlib.axes.Axes.pcolor` and `~matplotlib.axes.Axes.contour`:

* The new `~proplot.axes.Axes.heatmap` method invokes
  `~matplotlib.axes.Axes.pcolormesh` and draws ticks at the center of each
  box. This is more convenient for things like covariance matrices.
* Wherever colormaps are used, they can be divided into
  :ref:` discrete levels <ug_discrete>` using keyword arguments like `N` and `levels`
  -- similar to `~matplotlib.axes.Axes.contourf`. This is accomplished by applying
  `~proplot.colors.DiscreteNorm` as the new default colormap normalizer. This feature
  can be disabled by setting :rcraw:`image.discretenorm` to ``False``.
* The new `~proplot.colors.DivergingNorm` normalizer is perfect for data with a
  :ref:`natural midpoint <ug_norm>` and offers both "fair" and "unfair" scaling,
  and the new `~proplot.colors.LinearSegmentedNorm` normalizer can generate the
  uneven color gradations useful for :ref:`unusually distributed <ug_norm>` data.
* The `~matplotlib.axes.Axes.contour`, `~matplotlib.axes.Axes.contourf`,
  `~matplotlib.axes.Axes.pcolormesh`, and `~matplotlib.axes.Axes.pcolor` commands
  all accept a `labels` :ref:`keyword argument <ug_labels>` to draw contour labels
  and grid box labels on-the-fly. Labels are colored black or white according to the
  luminance of the underlying filled contour or grid box color.
* Matplotlib requires coordinate "centers" for contour plots and "edges" for
  pcolor plots. If you pass centers to pcolor, matplotlib treats them as
  edges, then silently trims one row/column of your data. ProPlot
  :ref:`changes this behavior <ug_2dstd>` so that your data is not trimmed.
* ProPlot fixes an irritating issue with saved vector graphics where white
  lines appear between `filled contours
  <https://stackoverflow.com/q/8263769/4970632>`__, `pcolor patches
  <https://stackoverflow.com/q/27092991/4970632>`__, and `colorbar patches
  <https://stackoverflow.com/q/15003353/4970632>`__.
* All :ref:`2D plotting methods <ug_2dplots>` methods accept
  `cmap` and `norm` :ref:`keyword arguments <ug_apply_cmap>`
  interpreted by `~proplot.constructor.Colormap` and
  `~proplot.constructor.Norm` and a `colorbar` :ref:`keyword argument <ug_cbars_axes>`
  for drawing colorbars at the specified location.

..
  ProPlot also provides *constistent behavior* when switching between
  different commands, for example `~matplotlib.axes.Axes.plot` and
  `~matplotlib.axes.Axes.scatter` or `~matplotlib.axes.Axes.contourf`
  and `~matplotlib.axes.Axes.pcolormesh`.

..
   ProPlot also uses wrappers to *unify* the behavior of various
   plotting methods.

..
  All positional arguments for 1D plotting methods are standardized by
  `~proplot.axes.standardize_1d`. All positional arguments for 2D
  plotting methods are standardized by `~proplot.axes.standardize_2d`.
  See :ref:`1D plotting methods <1d_plots>` and :ref:`2D plotting methods <2d_plots>`
  for details.

.. _why_cartopy_basemap:

Cartopy and basemap integration
===============================

.. rubric:: Limitation

There are two widely-used engines for working with geophysical data in
matplotlib: `cartopy`_ and `basemap`_.  Using cartopy tends to be
verbose and involve boilerplate code, while using basemap requires you to use
plotting commands on a separate `~mpl_toolkits.basemap.Basemap` object rather
than an axes object. They both require separate import statements and extra
lines of code to configure the projection.

Furthermore, when you use `cartopy`_ and `basemap`_ plotting
commands, "map projection" coordinates are the default coordinate system
rather than longitude-latitude coordinates. This choice is confusing for
many users, since the vast majority of geophysical data are stored with
longitude-latitude (i.e., "Plate Carrée") coordinates.

.. rubric:: Solution

ProPlot lets you specify geographic projections by simply passing
the `PROJ <https://proj.org>`__ name to `~proplot.ui.subplots` with
e.g. ``fig, ax = pplt.subplots(proj='pcarree')``. Alternatively, the
`~proplot.constructor.Proj` constructor function can be used to quickly generate
`cartopy.crs.Projection` and `~mpl_toolkits.basemap.Basemap` instances.

ProPlot also gives you access to various `cartopy`_ and `basemap`_
features via the `proplot.axes.GeoAxes.format` method.  This lets you quickly
modify geographic plot settings like latitude and longitude gridlines,
gridline labels, continents, coastlines, and political boundaries.

Finally, `~proplot.axes.GeoAxes` makes longitude-latitude coordinates the "default"
coordinate system by passing ``transform=ccrs.PlateCarree()``
to `~proplot.axes.CartopyAxes` plotting methods and ``latlon=True``
to `~proplot.axes.BasemapAxes` plotting methods. And to enforce global coverage
over the poles and across longitude seams, you can pass ``globe=True``
to any 2D plotting command, e.g. `~matplotlib.axes.Axes.contourf`
or `~matplotlib.axes.Axes.pcolormesh`.

See the :ref:`user guide <ug_proj>` for details.

..
  This is the right decision: Cartopy is integrated more closely with the matplotlib
  interface and is more amenable to further development.

.. _why_xarray_pandas:

Xarray and pandas integration
=============================

.. rubric:: Limitation

Data intended for visualization are commonly stored in array-like containers
that include metadata -- namely `xarray.DataArray`, `pandas.DataFrame`, and
`pandas.Series`. When matplotlib receives these objects, it simply ignores
the associated metadata. To create plots that are labeled with the metadata,
you must use the `xarray.DataArray.plot`, `pandas.DataFrame.plot`,
and `pandas.Series.plot` tools instead.

This approach is fine for quick plots, but not ideal for complex ones. It
requires learning a different syntax from matplotlib, and tends to encourage
using the `~matplotlib.pyplot` interface rather than the object-oriented interface.
These tools also include features that would be useful additions to matplotlib
in their own right, without requiring special containers and a separate interface.

.. rubric:: Solution

ProPlot reproduces many of the `xarray.DataArray.plot`,
`pandas.DataFrame.plot`, and `pandas.Series.plot` features on the
`~proplot.axes.Axes` plotting methods themselves.  Passing a
`~xarray.DataArray`, `~pandas.DataFrame`, or `~pandas.Series` through any
plotting method automatically updates the axis tick labels, axis labels,
subplot titles, and colorbar and legend labels from the metadata.  This
feature can be disabled by setting :rcraw:`autoformat` to ``False``.

Also, as :ref:`desribed above <why_plotting>`, ProPlot implements features
that were originally only available from the `xarray.DataArray.plot`,
`pandas.DataFrame.plot`, and `pandas.Series.plot` commands -- like grouped
bar plots, layered area plots, heatmap plots, and on-the-fly colorbars and
legends -- directly within the `~proplot.axes.Axes` plotting commands.

.. _why_aesthetics:

Aesthetic colors and fonts
==========================

.. rubric:: Limitation

A common problem with scientific visualizations is the use of "misleading" colormaps
like ``'jet'``. These colormaps tend to have jarring jumps in
`hue, saturation, and luminance <rainbow_>`_ that can trick the human eye into seeing
non-existing patterns. It is important to use "perceptually uniform" colormaps
instead. Matplotlib comes packaged with `some of its own <matplotlib_>`_, plus
colormaps from the `ColorBrewer <brewer_>`_ project, but several external projects
offer a larger variety of aesthetically pleasing "perceptually uniform" colormaps.

Matplotlib also "registers" the X11/CSS4 color names, but these are relatively
limited. The more intuitive and more numerous `XKCD color survey <xkcd_>`_ names can
be accessed with the ``'xkcd:'`` prefix, but this is cumbersome, and external projects
like `open color <opencolor_>`_ offer even more useful names.

Finally, matplotlib comes packaged with ``DejaVu Sans`` as the default font.
This font is open source and include glyphs for a huge variety of characters,
but unfortunately (in our opinion) it is not very aesthetically pleasing. It
can also be difficult to change the default matplotlib font.

.. rubric:: Solution

ProPlot adds new colormaps, new colors, and new fonts to help you make more
aesthetically pleasing figures.

* ProPlot adds colormaps from the `seaborn <seacolor_>`_, `cmocean <cmocean_>`_,
  `SciVisColor <sciviscolor_>`_, and `Scientific Colour Maps <fabio_>`_ projects.
  It also defines a few default :ref:`perceptually uniform colormaps <ug_perceptual>`
  and includes a `~proplot.colors.PerceptuallyUniformColormap` class for generating
  new ones. A :ref:`table of colormap <ug_cmaps_included>` and
  :ref:`color cycles <ug_cycles_included>` can be shown using
  `~proplot.demos.show_cmaps` and `~proplot.demos.show_cycles`. Old colormaps
  like ``'jet'`` can still be accessed, but this is discouraged.
* ProPlot adds colors from the `open color <opencolor_>`_ project and adds
  `XKCD color survey <xkcd_>`_ names without the ``'xkcd:'`` prefix after
  *filtering* them to exclude perceptually-similar colors and *normalizing* the
  naming pattern to make them more self-consistent. Old X11/CSS4 colors can still be
  accessed, but this is discouraged. A :ref:`table of color names <ug_colors_included>`
  can be shown using `~proplot.demos.show_colors`.
* ProPlot adds the entire `TeX Gyre <texgyre_>`_ font family to matplotlib. These
  are open-source fonts designed to resemble more popular, commonly-used fonts like
  Helvetica and Century. They are used for the new default serif, sans-serif, monospace,
  cursive, and "fantasy" fonts, and they are consistent across all workstations.
  A :ref:`table of font names <ug_fonts_included>` can be shown
  using `~proplot.demos.show_fonts`.

For details on adding new colormaps, colors, and fonts, see the
:ref:`.proplot folder <why_dotproplot>` section.

.. _why_colormaps_cycles:

Manipulating colormaps and cycles
=================================

.. rubric:: Limitation

In matplotlib, colormaps are implemented with the
`~matplotlib.colors.LinearSegmentedColormap` class, representing "smooth" color
gradations, and the `~matplotlib.colors.ListedColormap` class, representing
"discrete" color sets. They are generally cumbersome to modify or create from scratch.
Meanwhile, property cycles used for individual plot elements are implemented
with the `~cycler.Cycler` class. They are also cumbersome to modify and they cannot be
"registered" by name like colormaps.

The `seaborn`_ package introduces "color palettes" to make working with colormaps
and property cycles easier, but it would be nice to have similar features integrated
more closely with the matplotlib interface.

..
   Colormap identification is also suboptimal, since the names are case-sensitive, and
   reversed versions of each colormap are not guaranteed to exist.

.. rubric:: Solution

In ProPlot, it is easy to manipulate colormaps and property cycles:

* The `~proplot.constructor.Cycle` constructor function can be used to make
  new property cycles and retrieve named property cycle colors. It can also
  make property cycles by splitting up the colors from registered or
  on-the-fly `~matplotlib.colors.LinearSegmentedColormap`\ s. Property cycle
  names are "registered" by adding them as `~matplotlib.colors.ListedColormap`
  instances. Arbitrary cycles can be displayed using `~proplot.demos.show_cycles`.
* The `~proplot.constructor.Colormap` constructor function can be used to
  slice and merge existing colormaps or generate brand new colormaps. It can
  also return the `~matplotlib.colors.ListedColormap`\ s containing property
  cycle colors for use with commands like ``pcolor`` (useful, e.g., for
  categorical data). It can also be used to create new
  `~proplot.colors.PerceptuallyUniformColormap`\ s. Arbitrary colormaps can be
  displayed using `~proplot.demos.show_cmaps`.

Importing ProPlot also makes all colormap and property cycle names case-insensitive,
and colormaps can be reversed or cyclically shifted by 180 degrees simply by
appending ``'_r'`` or ``'_s'`` to the colormap name. This is powered by the
`~proplot.colors.ColormapDatabase` dictionary, which replaces matplotlib's
native colormap database.

.. _why_norm:

Physical units engine
=====================

.. rubric:: Limitation

Matplotlib uses figure-relative units for the margins `left`, `right`,
`bottom`, and `top`, and axes-relative units for the column and row spacing
`wspace` and `hspace`.  Relative units tend to require "tinkering" with
numbers until you find the right one. And since they are *relative*, if you
decide to change your figure size or add a subplot, they will have to be
readjusted.

Matplotlib also requires users to set the figure size `figsize` in inches.
This may be confusing for users outside of the United States.


.. rubric:: Solution

ProPlot introduces the physical units engine `~proplot.utils.units` for
interpreting `figsize`, `figwidth`, `figheight`, `refwidth`, `refheight`,
`left`, `right`, `top`, `bottom`, `wspace`, `hspace`, and arguments in a
few other places. Acceptable units include inches, centimeters, millimeters,
pixels, `points <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(typography)>`__, `picas
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pica_(typography)>`__, and `em-heights
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Em_(typography)>`__.
Em-heights are particularly useful, as the labels already present
can be useful "rulers" for figuring out the amount of space needed.

`~proplot.utils.units` is also used to convert settings passed to
`~proplot.config.rc` from arbitrary physical units to *points* -- for
example :rcraw:`ticklen`, :rcraw:`title.size`, and
:rcraw:`title.pad`.  See the :ref:`user guide <ug_units>` for details.

.. _why_rc:

Flexible global settings
========================

.. rubric:: Limitation

In matplotlib, there are several `~matplotlib.rcParams` that you often want
to set all at once, like the tick lengths and spine colors.  It is also
often desirable to change these settings for individual subplots rather
than globally.

.. rubric:: Solution

In ProPlot, you can use the `~proplot.config.rc` object to change lots of
settings at once with convenient shorthands.  This is meant to replace
matplotlib's `~matplotlib.rcParams` dictionary. Settings can be changed
with ``pplt.rc.key = value``, ``pplt.rc[key] = value``,
``pplt.rc.update(...)``, with the `~proplot.axes.Axes.format` method, or with
the `~proplot.config.RcConfigurator.context` method. ProPlot also adds a bunch
of new settings for controlling proplot-specific features.
See the :ref:`user guide <ug_config>` for details.

.. _why_dotproplot:

Loading saved settings
======================

.. rubric:: Limitation

Matplotlib `~matplotlib.rcParams` settings can be changed using a
``matplotlibrc`` file in the same directory as your python script. But it
can be difficult to design and store your own colormaps and color cycles for
future use. It is also difficult to get matplotlib to use custom ``.ttf`` and
``.otf`` font files, which may be desirable when you are working on
Linux servers with limited font selections.

.. rubric:: Solution

ProPlot settings can be changed using a ``~/.proplotrc`` file in the home
directory or by adding files named ``.proplotrc`` or ``proplotrc`` to
either 1) the current directory or 2) any parent directories. This
can be useful when working in projects with lots of subfolders. See
the :ref:`user guide <ug_config>` for details.

ProPlot also automatically loads colormaps, color cycles, colors, and font files
saved in the ``~/.proplot/cmaps``,  ``~/.proplot/cycles``, ``~/.proplot/colors``,
and ``~/.proplot/fonts``, folders in your home directory.  You can save colormaps and
color cycles to these folders simply by passing ``save=True`` to
`~proplot.constructor.Colormap` and `~proplot.constructor.Cycle`.  To *manually*
load from these folders, e.g. if you have added files to these folders but you do
not want to restart your ipython session, simply call `~proplot.config.register_cmaps`,
`~proplot.config.register_cycles`, `~proplot.config.register_colors`,
or `~proplot.config.register_fonts`.

..
   As mentioned above, ProPlot introduces the `~proplot.constructor.Colormap`
   and `~proplot.constructor.Cycle` functions for designing your own
   colormaps and color cycles.
