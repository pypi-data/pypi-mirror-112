def create_object_connections(points, lines, tol_distance=1):
    """Connects points to a line network.

    Generally, the nearest point of the next line is used as connection the point.
    Depending on the geometry, there are 3 options, the connection is created:
    - nearest point is line ending => the connection line starts from this line ending
    - nearest point is on the next line:
      a) line endings are outside the tolerance => line is split and the nearest point
      is used as connection point
      b) line endings are within the tolerance distance => the next line ending is
      used as connection point

    The tolerance distance avoids the generation of short line elements.
    This is for example the case if two buildings are directly opposite of the street.
    Using simply the nearest point method could result in very short lines.


    Parameters
    ----------
    points : geopandas.GeoDataFrame
        Points which should be connected to the line. GeoDataFrame with Points as geometry.
    lines : geopandas.GeoDataFrame
        The line-network to which the Points should be connected. The line geometry needs to
        consists of simple lines based on one starting and one ending point. LineStrings
        which contain more than 2 points are not allowed.
    tol_distance : float
        Tolerance distance for choosing the end of the line instead of the nearest point.

    Returns
    -------
