# exurl package - The split urls to many urls approval on patameters!

With exurl, you can split one url or multiple urls to many approval on patameters count , change parameter value in url to you want but change one by one and return all in list.

# Overview
The exurl python package was written with fast use in mind. It provides the following key features at present 
- take url and change parameters value to you want, one by one 
- take urls list and change parameters value to you want, again one by one
- all results will returned in list


## why exurl !
when you programming web testing tools should interested GET requests and this requests contains on [parameters] and you want to testing this parameters one by one in the right way
example..
now you programming xss testing tool , will send payload in all parameters and then make match on this payload in response body was it filtered or not ?
in normal will send :- 
```
https://www.example.com/search.php?q=<payload>&countPage=<payload>&art=<payload>
```
but this is very bad , you should send as follows..
```
https://www.example.com/search.php?q=<payload>&countPage=7&art=1
https://www.example.com/search.php?q=someSearch&countPage=<payload>&art=1
https://www.example.com/search.php?q=someSearch&countPage=7&art=<payload>
```
and then make match on every request
exurl will take url or urls list and will split all parameters inside url alike above example
