Deprecation notice
==================

To avoid name collision with the igraph project, the original igraph visualization
library has been renamed to `jgraph` in December 2015. The `igraph` package on
PyPI will soon be used by the igraph project.

The authors of `jgraph` (ex-igraph) and `python-igraph` (soon-to-be igraph)
project have agreed on a transition period during which old projects still
using `igraph` as a PyPI dependency will receive an error while trying to
import igraph in their own projects. The transition period ends on Sep 1 2021.

Things to do now
----------------

If you wanted to install the graph visualization library by Patrick Fuller,
please install `jgraph` instead. You have time until Sep 1 2021 to do this.

If you wanted to install the Python interface of the igraph network analysis
library, please install `python-igraph` instead. After Sep 1 2021, you can
start installing `igraph` instead. `python-igraph` will keep on working at
least until Sep 1 2022.
