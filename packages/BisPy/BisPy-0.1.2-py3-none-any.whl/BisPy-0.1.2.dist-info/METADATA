## Description
**BisPy** is a Python package for the computation of the maximum bisimulation of directed graphs. At the moment it supports the following algorithms:
- Paige-Tarjan
- Dovier-Piazza-Policriti
- Saha

An brief introduction to the problem can be found [here](https://bispy-bisimulation-in-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest#a-brief-introduction-to-bisimulation).

## Usage
### Paige-Tarjan, Dovier-Piazza-Policriti
Compute the maximum bisimulation of a graph (represented by an object of type `networkx.DiGraph`):
```python
> import networkx as nx
> from bispy import paige_tarjan, dovier_piazza_policriti

# we create the graph
> graph = networkx.balanced_tree(2,3)

# Paige-Tarjan's algorithm
> paige_tarjan(graph)
[(7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14), (3, 4, 5, 6), (1, 2), (0,)]

# and Dovier-Piazza-Policriti's algorithm
> dovier_piazza_policriti(graph)
[(7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14), (3, 4, 5, 6), (1, 2), (0,)]
```

More about the available features (like using a *labeling set*) is discussed in the documentation for [Paige-Tarjan](https://bispy-bisimulation-in-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/algorithms/paige_tarjan.html)'s and [Dovier-Piazza-Policriti](https://bispy-bisimulation-in-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/algorithms/dovier_piazza_policriti.html)'s algorithms.

### Saha
The interface for using *Saha*'s algorithm is a little bit different since we do not want to rebuild the *BisPy* representation of the graph from scratch.
```python
> import networkx as nx
> from bispy import decorate_nx_graph, to_tuple_list, paige_tarjan_qblocks, saha

# we create the graph
> graph = networkx.balanced_tree(2,3)

# we build its BisPy representation
> vertexes, qblocks = decorate_nx_graph(graph)
# compute the maximum bisimulation. `maximum_bisimulation is a list of `_QBlock` objects
> maximum_bisimulation = paige_tarjan_qblocks(qblocks)

# from now on we can update the maximum bisimulation incrementally, everytime
# we add a new edge to the graph
> new_edges_list = random_edges_generator()
> for edge in new_edges_list:
>    maximum_bisimulation = saha(maximum_bisimulation, vertexes, edge)
>    # print the current maximum bisimulation
>    print(to_tuple_list(maximum_bisimulation))
```

Note that *Saha*'s algorithm must be applied on a **maximum bisimulation**, otherwise it is going to return wrong results. This is why we called `paige_tarjan_qblocks` (which is just a version of *Paige-Tarjan*'s algorithm which can be applied to the variable `qblocks`) before the call to *Saha*'s algorithm.

You can read more about [Saha](https://bispy-bisimulation-in-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/algorithms/saha.html#)'s algorithm and the module [graph_decorator](https://bispy-bisimulation-in-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/utilities/graph_decorator.html) on the documentation.

## Dependencies and installation
**BisPy** requires requires the modules `llist, networkx`. The code is tested
for *Python 3*, while compatibility with *Python 2* is not guaranteed. It can
be installed using `pip` or directly from the source code.

## Documentation
We used [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/) and
[ReadTheDocs](https://readthedocs.org/) for code documentation. You can view
the documentation [here](https://bispy-bisimulation-in-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest).
