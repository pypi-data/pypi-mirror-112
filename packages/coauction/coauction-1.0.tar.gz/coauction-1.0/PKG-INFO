         ### Steps for using the library
        ```python
        import coauction
        # total_candidates : total number of participants
        # bidding_sequence: arrary containing timeseries data in format [[candidate_id,candidate_offer],[candidate_id,candidate_offer] ....]
        # relation_list: array containing relationship in form of [[sender,receiver],..] here 1 represents the person who won the bidding, 2 repreents the second last bidding candidate etc.
        # alpha: it determine the discount ratio for each relationship present in relation_list
        results=coauction.response(total_candidates,bidding_sequence,relation_list,alpha)
        # results[0] contains complete list of amount each candidate gets, and results[1] contains the amount in form of a dictionary,
        # with candidate_id as key, and amount as value.
        ```
        
        ### Installing module using PyPi:
        ```python
        pip install coauction
        ```
        In our system, the candidate_id begins with 1 in the dictionary based response.
