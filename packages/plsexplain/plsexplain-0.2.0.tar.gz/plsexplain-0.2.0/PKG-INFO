Create an explainable AI dashboard for your machine learning model. plsexplain,
or please, explain is a question that you may want to ask your computer after
you've trained a machine learning model.

## Getting started

You can install this tool as a python package on your machine by using the
following command in your favorite shell:

```shell
pip install plsexplain
```

After you've installed the package, use the following command to get an
explainable AI dashboard for your trained model:

```shell
plsexplain <path-to-model> <path-to-sample-set>
```

Currently, we support models trained with scikit-learn, but we're planning on
supporting tensorflow and pytorch as well.

The sample set, is a small dataset containing samples you want to use in the
dashboard for explanations based on sample data. We only support using
CSV files at the moment.

## Documentation

Please refer to the documentation for more information on how to use the tool
for various types of models and sample datasets.
