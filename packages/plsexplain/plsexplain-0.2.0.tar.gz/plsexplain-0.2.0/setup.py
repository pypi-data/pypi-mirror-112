We only support using\nCSV files at the moment.\n\n## Documentation\n\nPlease refer to the documentation for more information on how to use the tool\nfor various types of models and sample datasets.\n\n[ðŸ“– Read the documentation][DOCUMENTATION]\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe welcome contributions to this project.
