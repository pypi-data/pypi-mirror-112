# Kingfisher

Kingfisher is a fast and flexible program for procurement of sequence files from public data sources, including the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA), NCBI SRA, Amazon AWS and Google Cloud. It's input is an "Run" accession e.g. DRR001970.

It attempts to download data from a series of methods, which it attempts in order until one works. Then the downloaded data is converted to an output SRA / FASTQ / FASTA / GZIP file format as required. Both download and extraction phases are usually quicker than using the NCBI's SRA toolkit.

This software was originally known as `ena-fast-download`. Kingfisher implements
almost all of that tool's functionality, but also handles data sources other
than ENA. See the 'Usage' section for the equivalent invocation.

The `ena-ascp` method of this tool was built based on the very helpful bio-stars
thread https://www.biostars.org/p/325010/ written by @ATpoint. To find run
identifiers to be used as input to kingfisher, you might find the [SRA
explorer](https://ewels.github.io/sra-explorer/) site helpful.

## Installation

Kingfisher can be installed by installing its conda dependencies as follows

```
conda create -c conda-forge -c bioconda -n kingfisher pigz python extern curl sra-tools
conda activate kingfisher
git clone https://github.com/wwood/kingfisher-download
cd kingfisher-download/bin
export PATH=$PWD:$PATH
kingfisher -h
```

Optionally, to use the `ena-ascp` method, an Aspera connect client is also required.
See https://www.ibm.com/aspera/connect/ or https://www.biostars.org/p/325010/

## Usage

```
kingfisher get -r ERR1739691 -m ena-ascp aws-http prefetch
```
This will download `.fastq.gz` files of the run ERR1739691 from the ENA, or
failing that, downloads an .sra file from the Amazon AWA Open Data Program and
then converts to FASTQ, or failing that use NCBI prefetch to download and
convert that to FASTQ.

Output files are put into the current working directory.

### Method details

|__method__ |__description__ |
| --- | --- |
|`ena-ascp`|Download `.fastq.gz` files from ENA using Aspera, which can then be further converted. This is the fastest method since no `fasterq-dump` is required.|
|`ena-ftp`|Download `.fastq.gz` files from ENA using `curl`, which can then be further converted. This is relatively fast since no `fasterq-dump` is required.|
|`prefetch`|Download .SRA file using NCBI's prefetch from sra-tools, which is then extracted with `fasterq-dump`.|
|`aws-http`|Download .SRA file from AWS Open Data Program using `curl`, which is then extracted with `fasterq-dump`.|
|`aws-cp`|Download .SRA file from AWS using `aws s3 cp`, which is then extracted with fasterq-dump. May require payment, probably not.|
|`gcp-cp`|Download .SRA file from Google Cloud `gsutil`, which is then extracted with fasterq-dump. Requires payment.|

### Near parity with ena-fast-download

Ena-fast-download was the original name for this tool. To imitate that tool's
functionality:

```
kingfisher get -r ERR1739691 -m ena-ascp
```

## FAQ
If you see this error `/bin/sh: 1: ascp: not found` as below:

then you have not installed the Aspera client correctly. See the Installation section of this document.
