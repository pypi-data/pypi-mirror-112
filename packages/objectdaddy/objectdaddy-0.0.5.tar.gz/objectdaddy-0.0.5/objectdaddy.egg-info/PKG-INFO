Description: # Object Daddy
        A simple, python-based object recognizer, basically an implementation of yolo-v3-tiny. This package is used for personal projects; I don't maintain it, so use at your own risk, and feel free to fork.
        
        
        ## Usage
        Basic usage is as follows. This project is built to work with rtsparty (also on pypi).
        
        You can get and recognize one frame using the following:
        ```python
        from rtsparty import Stream
        from objectdaddy import Daddy
        
        
        stream = Stream()
        daddy = Daddy()
        
        frame = stream.get_frame()
        results, frame = daddy.process_frame(frame)
        for detection in results:
            detection.identify()
        ```
        
        For continuous recognition, use the following code.
        ```python
        from rtsparty import Stream
        from objectdaddy import Daddy
        
        
        stream = Stream()
        daddy = Daddy()
        
        
        try:
            while True:
                frame = stream.get_frame()
                if stream.is_frame_empty(frame):
                    continue
                daddy.process_frame(frame)
                for detection in daddy.get_current_detections():
                    if not detection.has_been_processed_downstream:
                        detection.identify()
                        detection.has_been_processed_downstream = True
        except KeyboardInterrupt:
            pass
        ```
        
        The code makes the attempt to recognize objects across multiple frames, and keep a list of objects in memory accessed with the get_current_detections() function.
        
        
        ## Notes
        - This package supports only CPU-based inference.
