Features of ProbNum
*******************

Probability
-----------

Random variables are the main objects in ProbNum. They represent uncertainty about a numerical quantity via their
distribution. A probabilistic numerical method takes random variables as inputs and also outputs random variables.

Linear Algebra
--------------

Linear algebra is fundamental to arguably most of scientific computation. ProbNum defines (finite-dimensional) linear
operators in a memory-efficient manner and implements probabilistic numerical methods to solve linear systems.

Ordinary Differential Equations
-------------------------------

The behaviour of complex systems which evolve over time is often described via the use of ordinary differential equations.
ProbNum provides a set of methods to solve ordinary differential equations based on filtering approaches which quantify
the uncertainty introduced by discretization.

Bayesian Filtering and Smoothing
--------------------------------

Bayesian filtering and smoothing provides a framework for efficient inference in state space models.
For non-linear state space components, ProbNum provides linearization techniques that enables
Gaussian filtering and smoothing in more complex dynamical systems.
