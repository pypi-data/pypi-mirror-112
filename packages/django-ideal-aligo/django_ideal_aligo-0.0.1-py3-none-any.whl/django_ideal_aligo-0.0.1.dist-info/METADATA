Polls is a Django app to conduct Web-based polls. For each question,
visitors can choose between a fixed number of answers.

Detailed documentation is in the "docs" directory.

Quick start
-----------

1. Add "polls" to your INSTALLED_APPS setting like this::

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        ...
        'aligo',
    ]


2. Run ``python manage.py migrate`` to create the polls models.

3. Start the development server and visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
   to create a poll (you'll need the Admin app enabled).
