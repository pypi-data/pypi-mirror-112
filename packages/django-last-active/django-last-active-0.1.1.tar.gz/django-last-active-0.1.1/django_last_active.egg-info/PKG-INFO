Description: last_active
        ===========
        
        last_active is a Django app to track when a user is last active on a
        website. The last active time is kept on the database.
        
        It was forked from ``django-last-seen``.
        
        The intention is to eventually add weekly active user tracking feature
        as well.
        
        Supports Software
        -----------------
        
        -  Python: 3.8, 3.9
        -  Django: 3.2
        
        Support Policy
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        For Python, we will always support the latest two minor versions
        starting with 3.8 and 3.9.
        
        When a new Python minor version is generally available, we will have two
        releases:
        
        1. a ``-final`` release for the current major version that includes the
           latest Python minor
        2. a brand new major version that will drop the oldest supported Python
           version
        
        For Django, at any point in time, there will be a minimum of two or
        three versions with active support by Django Foundation.
        
        Therefore, this plugin will similarly follow the same road map but with
        a 2 month delay.
        
        1. when a new Django major version is generally available, the plugin
           will release a new major version that supports it within 2 months.
        2. when a new Django minor version is generally available, the plugin
           will release a new minor version that supports it within 2 months.
        3. when a Django minor version ends its extended support, the plugin
           will deprecate any versions that support that version 2 months later.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        1. Add “last_active” to your INSTALLED_APPS setting like this
        
        ::
        
               INSTALLED_APPS = [
                   ...
                   'last_active',
               ]
        
        2. Add ‘last_active.middleware.LastActiveMiddleware’ to
           MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES tuple found in your settings file.
        
        3. Run ``python manage.py migrate`` to create the last_active models.
