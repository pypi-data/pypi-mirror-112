        Incident irradiance recipe for Pollination
        
        This recipe calculates the incident irradiance for each time step provided by a wea file.
        The outputs are stored under `results/direct` and `results/total`. Nighttime hours are
        filtered before running the simulation. To match the results for each of the hours,
        see the list of hours in sun-up-hours.txt.
        
        ## Methods
        
        This recipe calculates the total amount of Radiation by calculating the direct sunlight
        radiation from sun disks and adding them to the contribution from indirect sky radiation.
        
        ```console
        incident_radiation = direct_sun_radiation + indirect_sky_radiation
        ```
        
        The recipe is structured in a manner that ambient bounces are not included.
