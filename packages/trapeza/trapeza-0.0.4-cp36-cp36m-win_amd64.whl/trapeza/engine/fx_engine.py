class FXEngine(BaseEngine):
    """
    Derived from BaseEngine class. This implementation is meant to be used with FXStrategy (and FXAccount).
    Strategy names must not contain any other strategy's name as substring (must truly be unique).
    In principal, this implementation works with any class objects derived from BaseAccount and BaseStrategy.

    USES SLOTS: ['strategies', 'name', 'lookbacks', 'reference_currency', '_tmp_dir',
                 'is_analyzed', 'analysis_results', 'standard_analysis_results', 'metrics',
                 'run_register', 'has_run', 'price_data', 'volume_data', 'is_loaded_from_file', 'clean_cache_artifacts',
                 'n_jobs', 'from_child', '_finalizer', '_ignore_type_checking']

    This class is a backtest automation designed for use with FXStrategy.
    The overall goal of this backtesting framework is to retrieve statistically analyzable results. Therefore, the
    backtest engine slices coherent and consecutive time series sub-portions from the supplied data and executes a
    trading strategy (supplied as FXStrategy class object). The backtest engine uses different window sizes and
    different start indices for slicing time series sub-portion. Thereby, strategies can be tested for dependencies of
    their performance with respect to time-being-invested and to different market phases (if they are captured
    within the supplied data). If the underlying supplied data can be interpreted as random walk (e.g. stock prices),
    this methodology is comparable to random sampling of strategy execution results, which in turn can be statistically
    interpreted. This is especially useful for strategies, which are path-dependent. This approach roughly follows the
    idea of Monte Carlo analysis.

    For backtesting, price data has to be provided, whereas volume data is optional. Furthermore, by calling
    FXEngine.run(), supplied price and volume data (the latter defaults to None) are stored in class attributes
    FXEngine.price_data and FXEngine.volume_data. This is done to unambiguously connect used data and analysis results
    (e.g. when saving and re-loading FXEngine class object).

    In order to handle the data volume, which is produced by running strategies over a quite large domain of sampled
    data (sliced sub-portioned time series from supplied data), strategy results are stored in a temporary directory.
    For each strategy run, all results from the FXStrategy class are stored (FXStrategy.signals,
    FXStrategy.positions, FXStrategy.total_balances, FXStrategy.merged positions, FXStrategy.merged_total_balances)
    in a temporary file, as well as start and end balances (given in a user specified reference currency) per run.
    The temporary file structure is organized as follows:
        - directory:
            -[cache_dir]/[name_id]_xxx,
                e.g.: trapeza/__cache__/[name_id]_xxx where name_id is the name_id of FXEngine
                this temporary directory is created for each new object of FXEngine. cache_dir serves as parent
                directory where new FXEngine objects create their own temporary (sub-)directory named name_id.
        - files:
            - decision-function-loc_xxx
                dict: decision_fnc_loc[strategy.name] = inspect.getsource(strategy.strategy_func)
            - [strategy_name]_[window_size]_[start_index]_run_xxx
                (window_size: does not include lookback size, but only number of simulation steps)
                dict: {'signals': strategy.signals, 'positions': strategy.positions,
                       'merged_positions': strategy.merged_positions, 'total_balances': strategy.total_balances,
                       'merged_total_balances': strategy.merged_total_balances}
            - [strategy_name]_[window_size]_runthrough_run_xxx
                (window_size: len(data)-strategy.lookback)
                same as [strategy_name]_[window_size]_[start_index]_run_xxx, but this file is created if runthrough
                is enforced at FXEngine.run(), where start_index is replaced by the string 'runthrough'
                dict: {'signals': strategy.signals, 'positions': strategy.positions,
                       'merged_positions': strategy.merged_positions, 'total_balances': strategy.total_balances,
                       'merged_total_balances': strategy.merged_total_balances}
            - runs-total-balances-start-end_xxx
                dict: run_balances[(strategy.name, len_data-strategy.lookback, 'runthrough')] = [start_balance,
                                                                                                 end_balance]
                        (for runthrough)
                      run_balances[(strategy.name, window_size, start_index)] = [start_balance, end_balance]
                        (for normal runs)
    The location of the temporary directory can be specified by the user (see docstring FXEngine.__init__).
    Housekeeping of the temporary directory is handled by this class as far as possible. Nevertheless, temporary files
    might leak, leading to a cluttered disk storage. Therefore the user either can set the param:clean_cache_artifacts
    at FXEngine.__init__ to True, which tries to clean up temporary directories as far as possible, or manually
    clean up.
    Be sure not to accidentally delete other temporary files when using param:clean_cache_artifacts. This can be
    avoided by specifying a unique location at FXEngine.__init__ (see docstring of FXEngine.__init__)

    Furthermore the user can specify minimal and maximal window lengths as well as the total number of data slices for
    running FXStrategy on. Additionally, the user can enforce one run on the entire data frame independent of any
    window specifications, which is entitled with the start index 'runthrough'.
    When accessing results, each simulation run performed by FXEngine.run() is specified by its window length
    (regarding the sliced time series sub-portion of supplied data) and its start index.
    Start index indicates start point for slicing data into samples. The data is then sliced to
    [start_index: start_index + window_length + lookback]. Start index therefore factors in lookback size (opposed
    to window length). Window length, on the other hand, does not factor in lookback size, but only describes the total
    number of time steps on which the strategy should be executed on. Window size only describes the number of
    simulation steps within the respective sampled time series (lookback not factored in, see FXStrategy for
    further details of lookbacks).
    If a run on the entire data frame is enforced (see docstring of FXEngine.run() method), then the start index is
    entitled with 'runthrough' (as opposed to a integer value which specifies the time step index at which the
    simulation starts - not including lookback).
    Multiple FXStrategy class objects can be passed to FXEngine, which are then run on the same
    sliced data samples. This is especially handy for comparing and benchmarking different strategies.
    Between each run of FXEngine, all strategies are reset to the initial status to ensure correct results. All
    strategies are reset as well as soon as FXEngine has completed its run.

    The main goal of FXEngine is gathering statistical metrics instead of gathering strategy execution results as
    time series data. Nevertheless, all strategy execution data are stored as temporary file. Results can therefore be
    accessed via opening those temporary files (FXEngine._tmp_dir gives path to directory, see above temporary file
    structure for naming convention of temporary files) or via FXEngine.load_result(). Make sure to release loaded files
    etc. such that temporary file directory can be cleaned up afterwards.

    As mentioned, the main goal of FXEngine is to gather statistical metrics. This is done via FXEngine.analyze by
    passing a dictionary of metric names and metric functions. Currently, only metrics, which operate on the total
    balance time series values of a strategy expressed in a reference currency (namely FXStrategy.merged_total_balances
    is passed to any metrics function, see documentation of FXStrategy for further information), are supported.
    A standard dictionary of metrics is already implemented:
        {'total_rate_of_return': _std_tot_rate_of_ret, 'volatility': _std_annual_vola,
         'expected_rate_of_return': _std_annual_exp_rate_of_ret,
         'expected_rate_of_log_return': _std_exp_rate_of_log_ret,
         'sharpe_ratio': _std_annual_sharpe, 'sortino_ratio': _std_annual_sortino,
         'value_at_risk': _std_var, 'max_drawdown': _std_max_drawdown
         },
         (see FXEngine.analyze() for detailed description)
    where metrics functions are implemented in trapeza.metric. Users can supply any additional metrics
    dict to FXEngine.analyze(). The FXEngine.analyze() method is only callable, if FXEngine.run() has been called
    beforehand. FXEngine.analyze() loads results from temporary directory as basis of any calculations, but only uses
    'merged_total_balances'. Results of FXEngine.analyze() are accessible via FXEngine.standard_analysis_results
    (standard metrics) and FXEngine.analysis_results (user-specified metrics), which are both a dict of dicts:
        FXEngine.standard_analysis_results[strategy_name][window_size, start_index] = metric_value.

    In the case of custom metrics dictionary (respective the default metrics dictionary, if none is supplied), the
    metric names (keys of FXEngine.analysis_results[strategy_name]/ param:metric_dict of FXEngine.analyze()) are listed
    within FXEngine.metrics class attribute.

    A custom dictionary of metrics can be passed to FXEngine.analyze(). param:metric must have following signature:
             dictionary keys: str,
                              metric name
             dictionary values: callable function,
                                callable function must have following call signature:

                                    float = metric_fnc(merged_total_balances)

                                    merged_total_balances: list, see trapeza.strategy.fx_strategy.FXStrategy class

    Currently, metrics can only be evaluated on 'merged_total_balances' of each strategy of FXEngine
    (see FXStrategy for further information regarding 'merged_total_balances': FXStrategy.merged_total_balances).
    If param:metric_dict is None at FXEngine.analyze(), a default metrics dictionary is used: see FXEngine.analyze().
    Results of param:metric_dict are stored in FXEngine.analysis_results, which is a dict (keys: strategy names) of
    dict (keys: (window_size, start_index) as strings or ints, values: metric_value):
        FXEngine.analysis_results[strategy.name][window_size, start_index] = metric_value

    FXEngine.standard_analysis_results and FXEngine.analysis_results are computed in pretty much the same way and hold
    their analysis results in the same format (as dict of dicts).

    FXEngine.analysis_results holds all analysis results of custom metrics dictionary, whereas FXEngine.metrics
    holds all keys of FXEngine.analysis_results as strings (metric names of custom dictionary passed to
    FXEngine.analyze()).

    Each metric is calculated on each simulation run of FXEngine.run() (sampled sliced time series sub-portion of
    supplied data, see description above). Those metrics can then be used e.g. for further statistical analysis.
    trapeza.metric implements the most common financial metrics, which are also used in the default
    dicts.

    New strategies can be registered with the FXEngine.register() method, which overrides existing strategies in
    FXEngine class object. This method is used to avoid creating a new FXEngine class object. All internal class object
    attributes are reset or emptied (e.g. FXEngine.standard_analysis_results). In general, resetting during
    FXEngine.run() is always referenced to the status, at which strategies and their accounts (see FXAccount) where
    registered via FXEngine.register() or via FXEngine.__init__() (initial status from which to start benchmarking).

    !!! FXEngine should be closed explicitly by using FXEngine.close() !!!
    This deletes and cleans up all temporary files and directories and destroys the class object. Nevertheless,
    this is also done, when FXEngine class object is garbage collected, but users should not solely rely on that this
    automated clean up performs problem-free. Furthermore, if the main process gets unexpectedly interrupted, temporary
    files and directories might leak and might need manual clean up in order to avoid cluttering disk space (see
    description above).

    If any exception is thrown internally, e.g. by passing wrong arguments, FXEngine will perform an auto-clean up
    routine, which deletes all temporarily created files (same routine as in FXEngine.close()). Nevertheless,
    users shouldn't rely to heavily on this!!!

    FXEngine class object can be saved and loaded with its current internal states (e.g. metric dicts ect.).
    As all supplied data is also written internally to FXEngine.price_data and FXEngine.volume_data class attributes,
    data, that has been supplied to FXEngine.run(), is also saved and re-loaded into those attributes. If the user wants
    to reduce the size of the saved FXEngine files and has the data persistently saved separately, then set the
    attributes FXEngine.price_data=None and FXEngine.volume_data=None and re-set them after loading FXEngine class
    object via FXEngine.price_data=prices and FXEngine.volume_data=volumes.

    Furthermore, results from FXEngine.run() and FXEngine.analyze() can be visualised via FXDashboard. As the main goal
    of this library is numerical backtesting, FXDashboard only provides a minimal viable visualization implemented via
    Python Dash. FXDashboard analyzes results stored in temporary file structure. It is sufficient to only pass the
    FXEngine class object, as the path to those temporary files is stored in the FXEngine._tmp_dir attribute.
    Analysis results in FXEngine.standard_analysis_results and FXEngine.analysis_results are used by FXDashboard for
    visualization as well. Do not overwrite or manipulate class attributes or temporary files manually.

    FXEngine.run_register gives an overview of all windows and start indices, which were created/ used
    during FXEngine.run():
        FXEngine.run_register[strategy.name][window_size] = [start_index_0, start_index_1, ...]
    (dict of dict, window_size as integer).

        Initializes FXEngine class object for backtesting.
        Parallelization is implemented via joblib.

        Recommendation: For safety reasons, use loc_decision_functions=False in order to avoid that source code
                        of strategy decision function is written to a temporary file (which eventually might leak
                        if process is unexpectedly interrupted).
                        Be careful when using clean_cache_artifacts=True to not unintentionally delete temporary files
                        of other programs. Therefore set cache_dir appropriately (default setting should be safe to use)

        In most cases, if an exception is thrown internally, this class will auto-clean up all temporary files,
        which have been created by this class object. Nevertheless, users shouldn't rely to heavily on this
        auto-clean up.

        Each new FXEngine creates a new temporary sub-directory under cache_dir, which serves as some kind of parent
        directory of this library. FXEngine then stores all results as temporary files under the freshly created
        temporary sub-directory, which was created under cache_dir. It is recommended to use a unique cache_dir path
        (default argument should do the job well enough). If clean_cache_artifacts is set to true, all temporary
        sub-directories and temporary files created by any FXEngine class instance will be deleted and cleaned up
        (so be sure to use a cache_dir, which is not used by any other programs to avoid unintentionally deleting other
        program's temporary files). cache_dir will not be deleted by clean_cache_artifacts as, in general, it serves
        as some kind of parent directory for this library (or at least for FXEngine class).

        Start index takes lookback size of strategy into account such that the actual simulation starts from

        Opposed to start index, window length does not factor in lookback but just gives the total number

        strategy) as well as all results such as signals, positions, merged_positions, total_balances, merged_balances
        of strategies. Results are emptied out, depots and clocks are restored to the same status as of the time as
        they were bond to FXStrategy by initialization of FXStrategy after run() finishes. Resetting is also done
        at each loop within run(), such that each loop simulates a freshly initialized FXStrategy.run().

        Results of run() are dumped into temporary directory self._tmp_dir:
            'runs-total-balances-start-end_....':
                    dict,
                    key: (strategy.name, window_size, start_index)
                         or if runthrough: (strategy.name, len_data-strategy.lookback, 0)
                    value: [start_balance_at_t_0, end_balance_at_t_-1]

            '{}_{}_{}_run_...'.format(strategy.name, window_size, start_index):
                    dict,
                    key: str {'signals', 'positions', 'merged_positions', 'total_balances', 'merged_total_balances'}
                    value: respective FXStrategy result
            '{}_{len_data-lookback}_runthrough...':.format(strategy.name):
                    dict,
                    key: str {'signals', 'positions', 'merged_positions', 'total_balances', 'merged_total_balances'}
                    value: respective FXStrategy result

        Further temporary files:
            'lookbacks_.....':
                    dict,
                    keys: str, strategy name
                    value: int, lookback size
            'decision-function-loc_....':
                    dict,
                    keys: str, strategy name
                    value: str, line of codes

        win_size: Size of data sampling window, which describes number of simulation steps for corresponding data
                  sample. Size of lookback is excluded from this (e.g. sample size is win_size+lookback)
        start_ind: Index within param:data at which data sample starts. This already accounts for lookback, e.g.
                   simulation starts at index=lookback. start_ind describes where to start slicing for taking
                   respective data sample out of param:data: [start_ind: start_ind+win_size+lookback]
                   (start_ind already includes prepending lookback data)
        lookback: amount of historic data to prepend for each run, see FXStrategy

        The main goal of FXEngine is to perform statistical analysis via metrics instead of providing a full data log
        of all simulation runs. Nevertheless, results can be accessed via temporary files of self.load_result().

        :param price_data: dict with:
                     keys: currency pair as tuple of strings: (currency_0, currency_1)
                     values: list of floats as exchange rates per time step t or array of floats

                     {(base, quote): [rate_0, rate_1, ..., rate_t],
                      (base, quote): [rate_0, rate_1, ..., rate_t],
                      ...}

                     All values (list or array of floats) of all keys (currency pairs) have to be of same length.

                     If historic data shall be used by strategy_func (cf. lookback), historic data has to be prepended
                     manually to param:data, e.g.:
                         lookback = 3

                         {(base, quote): [rate_-3, rate_-2, rate_-1, rate_0, rate_1, ... rate_t],
                          (base, quote): [rate_-3, rate_-2, rate_-1, rate_0, rate_1, ... rate_t],
                          ...}

                     Data will be looped through one by one (time frame specified by lookback and current time step t
                     [size: lookback + 1]). Start time step is at index=lookback.

                     Exchange rate is expressed in FX notation convention (direct notation, not volume notation)
                     1.2 EUR|USD --> 1.2 USD for 1 EUR

                     None values allowed (if handling via accounts during account.tick(data_point_t) is ensured.
                     data_point_t is a data dict only containing time steps which are fed to strategy decision function
                     at each loop).

                     if accounts are patched with trapeza.account.order_management:
                        if None value occurs, order management is not executed (orders may expire at next tick) but only
                        _exec_heap, which manages processing of delayed transaction (e.g. due to processing time
                        of broker). Keys of param:data, that are not listed within account._order_heap
                        (list of all open orders annotated with base|quote pair), are ignored.
        :param reference_currency: str,
                                   reference currency in which to bill total balances of all accounts
        :param volume_data: None or dict,
                            If None, then None value is also passed to strategy decision function.
                            If dict, then dict must be in the same format as param:price_data. Instead of price data,
                                place volume data (or whatever data shall be used within strategy decision function) as
                                values. Keys (tuple of strings, which annotate e.g. currencies) do not have to be
                                identical to keys of param:price_data. No cross volume checking applied, which means
                                that e.g. ('BTC', 'EUR') does not have to match up against ('EUR', 'BTC'). Data input
                                at one's own caution. Lookbacks are handled in the same manner as in param:price_data.
        :param min_run_length: None or int > 0,

                               (len of data - lookback), then max_window_length is auto-restricted to max available
                               number of data time steps (len of data - lookback)
                               if None, max_run_length is set to maximum: len of data - lookback
                               if param:max_run_length <= min_run_length, then ValueError is thrown

                               strategy
                               if None, number of total runs will not be constrained (runs simulation on all possible
