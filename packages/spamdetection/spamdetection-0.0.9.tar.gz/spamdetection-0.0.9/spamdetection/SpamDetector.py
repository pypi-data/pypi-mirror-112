    Class implementing the prob_spam() and is_spam() public methods for

        mode : (optional) used to determine whether the is_spam() method
                behaves in an "aggressive" (few false negatives) or
                "permissive" (few false positives) manner. Can be set during
                initialization or with call to __set_mode__().
               
    Attributes:
        
        model : a sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline object containing preprocessing
                steps and a random forest model for the classification of
                text messages in either 'spam' or 'ham'
                
        mode : stores choice of mode. Can either be None, "aggressive" or 1, 
                "permissive" or 2.
               
        threshold : float between 0 and 1, automatically selected from preset
                    values when the mode attribute is set.
