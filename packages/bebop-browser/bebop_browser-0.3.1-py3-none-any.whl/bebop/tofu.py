The request could not complete because the certificate presented by the server \

If you are sure this new certificate can be trusted, press ":" and type the \
following command to remove the previous certificate from the local stash, \
then retry your request:

``` command to use to forget about the previous certificate
forget-certificate {hostname}

You can also manually remove the certificate line from the known hosts file in \
your user data directory.

## FAQ

### What is this mismatch about?

Gemini uses TOFU (Trust On First Use) to verify the identity of the server you \
are visiting. It means that the first time you visited this capsule, it showed \
you its unique ID, but this time the ID is different, so the trust is broken.

Capsule owners often tell in advance when they are about the use a new \
certificate, but they may have forgotten or you may have missed it. Maybe the \
old certificate expired and/or has been replaced for another reason (e.g. \
using a far away expiration time, borking certificates during a migration, â€¦)

### Am I being hacked?

Probably not, but if you are visiting a sensitive capsule, make sure you're \
confident enough before trusting this new certificate.

### How to ensure this new certificate can be trusted?

Can you join the owner through mail or instant messaging? This is the simplest \
way for you to make sure that the server is fine, and maybe alert the server \
owner that there might be an issue.
