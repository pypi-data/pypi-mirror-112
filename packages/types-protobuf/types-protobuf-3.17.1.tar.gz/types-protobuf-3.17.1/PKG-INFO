Description: ## Typing stubs for protobuf
        
        This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `protobuf` package.
        It can be used by type-checking tools like mypy, PyCharm, pytype etc. to check code
        that uses `protobuf`. The source for this package can be found at
        https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/master/stubs/protobuf. All fixes for
        types and metadata should be contributed there.
        
        Generated with aid from mypy-protobuf 2.6
        
        See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/master/README.md for more details.
        This package was generated from typeshed commit `4765978f6ceeb24e10bdf93c0d4b72dfb35836d4`.
