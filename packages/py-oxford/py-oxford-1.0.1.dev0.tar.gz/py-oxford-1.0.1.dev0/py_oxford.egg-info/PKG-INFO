        pyoxford is a python library for the [oxford dictionary API](https://developer.oxforddictionaries.com/).
        
        
        ## Installation
        
        Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install pyoxford.
        
        >Installation using pip
        
        ```bash
        pip install py-oxford
        ```
        >Installation from source
        
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/spacesudo/pyoxford.git
        cd pyoxford
        python setup.py
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```python
        from pyoxford import pyOxford
        
        dictionary = pyOxford()
        
        search = dictionary.entries("example") #search for "example"
        
        print(search)
        
        ```
        
        ## Configuration
        To configure the library pass your configurations to the *pyOxford()* class.
        ```python
        from pyoxford import pyOxford
        oxford = pyOxford(app_id = "<your id>",app_key = "<your key>",timeout = (2,6)) #timeout should be a tuple
        ```
        
        ## Common Issues
        
        >Authentification error
        
        Please now that the api key and id used for this package is for test purpose only.
        Some features of the API are not accessible with a Developer API credentials.
        
        *If you face any other issue please kindly let me know*
        
        
        
        ## Roadmap
        *Please know that this library is still under development*
        
        Future updates of this library will have advanced features and probably use other dictionary API for Meriam Webster support and others
        
        *while this library is production ready please remember to regularly update the library using ```pip install py-oxford --upgrade```*
