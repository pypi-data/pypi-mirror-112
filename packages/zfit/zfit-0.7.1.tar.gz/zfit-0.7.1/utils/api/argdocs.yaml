model.init.name: |1+
    Name of the PDF for a better visibility.
                Has no programmatical functional purpose.


minimizer.verbosity: |1+
 Verbosity of the minimizer. Has to be between 0 and 10.
               The verbosity has the meaning:

                - a value of 0 means quiet and no output
                - above 0 up to 5, information that is good to know but without
                  flooding the user, corresponding to a "INFO" level.
                - A value above 5 starts printing out considerably more and
                  is used more for debugging purposes.
                - Setting the verbosity to 10 will print out every
                  evaluation of the loss function and gradient.

                Some minimizer offer additional output which is also
                distributed as above but may duplicate certain printed values.

minimizer.tol: |1+
    Termination value for the
                    convergence/stopping criterion of the algorithm
                    in order to determine if the minimum has
                    been found. Defaults to 1e-3.
minimizer.criterion: |1+
    Criterion of the minimum. This is an
                    estimated measure for the distance to the
                    minimum and can include the relative
                    or absolute changes of the parameters,
                    function value, gradients and more.
                    If the value of the criterion is smaller
                    than ``loss.errordef * tol``, the algorithm
                    stopps and it is assumed that the minimum
                    has been found.
minimizer.strategy: |1+
    A class of type `ZfitStrategy` that takes no
                    input arguments in the init. Determines the behavior of the minimizer in
                    certain situations, most notably when encountering
                    NaNs. It can also implement a callback function.
minimizer.maxiter: |1+
    Approximate number of iterations.
                    This corresponds to roughly the maximum number of
                    evaluations of the `value`, 'gradient` or `hessian`.
minimizer.name: |1+
    Human readable name of the minimizer.
minimizer.maxcor: |1+
    Maximum number of memory history to keep
                    when using a quasi-Newton update formula such as BFGS.
                    It is the number of gradients
                    to “remember” from previous optimization
                    steps: increasing it increases
                    the memory requirements but may speed up the convergence.
minimizer.init.maxls: |1+
    Maximum number of linesearch points.

minimizer.scipy.gradient: |1+
    Define the method to use for the gradient computation
                    that the minimizer should use. This can be the
                    gradient provided by the loss itself or
                    method from the minimizer.
                    In general, using the zfit provided automatic gradient is
                    more precise and needs less computation time for the
                    evaluation compared to a numerical method but it may not always be
                    possible. In this case, zfit switches to a generic, numerical gradient
                    which in general performs worse than if the minimizer has its own
                    numerical gradient.
                    The following are possible choices:

                    If set to ``False`` or ``'zfit'`` (or ``None``; default), the
                    gradient of the loss (usually the automatic gradient) will be used;
                    the minimizer won't use an internal algorithm.


minimizer.scipy.gradient.internal: |1+
    ``True`` tells the minimizer to use its default internal
                    gradient estimation. This can be specified more clearly using the
                    arguments ``'2-point'`` and ``'3-point'``, which specify the
                    numerical algorithm the minimizer should use in order to
                    estimate the gradient.
minimizer.scipy.hessian: |1+
    Define the method to use for the hessian computation
                    that the minimizer should use. This can be the
                    hessian provided by the loss itself or
                    method from the minimizer.

                    While the exact gradient can speed up the convergence and is
                    often beneficial, this ain't true for the computation of the
                    (inverse) Hessian matrix.
                    Due to the $n^2$ number of entries (compared to $n$ in the
                    gradient) from the $n$ parameters, this can grow quite
                    large and become computationally expensive.

                    Therefore, many algorithms use an approximated (inverse)
                    Hessian matrix making use of the gradient updates instead
                    of calculating the exact matrix. This turns out to be
                    precise enough and usually considerably speeds up the
                    convergence.

                    The following are possible choices:

                    If set to ``False`` or ``'zfit'``, the
                    hessian defined in the loss (usually using automatic differentiation)
                    will be used;
                    the minimizer won't use an internal algorithm.
minimizer.scipy.hessian.internal: |1+
    A :class:`~scipy.optimize.HessianUpdateStrategy` that holds
                    an approximation of the hessian. For example
                    :class:`~scipy.optimize.BFGS` (which performs usually best)
                    or :class:`~scipy.optimize.SR1`
                    (sometimes unstable updates).
                    ``True``  (or ``None``; default) tells the minimizer
                    to use its default internal
                    hessian approximation.
                    Arguments ``'2-point'`` and ``'3-point'`` specify which
                    numerical algorithm the minimizer should use in order to
                    estimate the hessian. This is only possible if the
                    gradient is provided by zfit and not an internal numerical
                    method is already used to determine it.

         This implenemtation uses internally the
         `NLopt library <https://nlopt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.
         It is a

         different free optimization routines available online as well as
         original implementations of various other algorithms.




loss.init.model: |1+
   PDFs that return the normalized probability for
                *data* under the given parameters.
                If multiple model and data are given, they will be used
                in the same order to do a simultaneous fit.

loss.init.data: |1+
   Dataset that will be given to the *model*.
                If multiple model and data are given, they will be used
                in the same order to do a simultaneous fit.

loss.init.constraints: |1+
   Auxiliary measurements that add a term to the loss
                or terms that restrict the loss in an other way such as penalties.
loss.init.options: |1+
   Additional options (as a dict) for the loss.
                Current possibilities include:

                - 'subtr_const' (default True): subtract from each points
                  log probability density a constant that
                  is approximately equal to the average log probability
                  density in the very first evaluation before
                  the summation. This brings the initial loss value closer to 0 and increases,
                  especially for large datasets, the numerical stability.

                  The value will be stored ith 'subtr_const_value' and can also be given
                  directly.

                  The subtraction should not affect the minimum as the absolute
                  value of the NLL is meaningless. However,
                  with this switch on, one cannot directly compare
                  different likelihoods ablolute value as the constant
                  may differs! Use `create_new` in order to have a comparable likelihood
                  between different losses


                These settings may extend over time. In order to make sure that a loss is the
                same under the same data, make sure to use `create_new` instead of instantiating
                a new loss as the former will automatically overtake any relevant constants
                and behavior.




result.init.loss: |1+
    The loss function that was minimized.
                Usually, but not necessary, contains
                also the pdf, data and constraints.
result.init.params: |1+
    Result of the fit where each
                :py:class:`~zfit.Parameter` key has the
                value from the minimum found by the minimizer.

result.init.minimizer: |1+
    Minimizer that was used to obtain this `FitResult` and will be used to
                    calculate certain errors. If the minimizer
                    is state-based (like "iminuit"), then this is a copy
                    and the state of other `FitResults` or of the *actual*
                    minimizer that performed the minimization
                    won't be altered.
result.init.valid: |1+
    Indicating whether the result is valid or not. This is the strongest
                    indication and serves as
                    the global flag. The reasons why a result may be
                    invalid can be arbitrary, including but not exclusive:

                    - parameter(s) at the limit
                    - maxiter reached without proper convergence
                    - the minimizer may even converged but it is known that this is only a local minimum

                    To indicate the reason for the invalidity, pass a message.
result.init.edm: |1+
    The estimated distance to minimum
                    which is the criterion value at the minimum.
result.init.fmin: |1+
    Value of the function at the minimum.
result.init.criterion: |1+
    Criterion that was used during the minimization.
                    This determines the estimated distance to the
                    minimum (edm)
result.init.status: |1+
    A status code (if available) that describes
                    the minimization termination. 0 means a valid
                    termination.
result.init.converged: |1+
    Whether the fit has successfully converged or not.
                    The result itself can still be an invalid minimum
                    such as if the parameters are at or close
                    to the limits or in case another minimum is found.
result.init.message: |1+
    Human readable message to indicate the reason
                    if the fitresult is not valid.
                    If the fit is valid, the message (should)
                    be an empty string (or None),
                    otherwise it should denote the reason for the invalidity.
result.init.info: |1+
    Additional information (if available)
                    such as *number of gradient function calls* or the
                    original minimizer return message.
                    This is a relatively free field and _no single field_
                    in it is guaranteed to be stable.
                    Some recommended fields:

                    - *original*: contains the original returned object
                      by the minimizer used internally.
                    - *optimizer*: the actual instance of the wrapped
                      optimizer (if available)
result.init.approx: |1+
    Collection of approximations found during
                    the minimization process such as gradient and hessian.
result.init.niter: |1+
    Approximate number of iterations ~= number
                    of function evaluations ~= number of gradient evaluations.
                    This is an approximated value and the exact meaning
                    can differ between different minimizers.
result.init.evaluator: |1+
    Loss evaluator that was used during the
                    minimization and that may contains information
                    about the last evaluations of the gradient
                    etc which can serve as approximations.

result.init.values: |1+
    Values of the parameters at the
                    found minimum.
