Description: Installing Jare
        
        
        Since this is a python module, you have to have the module installed. 
        Know since I do have a windows and not mac or linux it might be a bit different but 
        mostly it is the same.
        
        To install Jare, simply open Command Promt(For Mac or Linux it is different, 
        you can google "how to install packages in mac/linux" if you have any of those) 
        and then type:
        
        pip install jare
        
        
        Commands:
        
        
        1.jare_run_list
        
        
        This Command takes 3 values:
        
        1.Input value (input(x))
        
        
        2.Questions list (questions = ["Hello", "How are you doing"])
        
        
        3. Answers List (answers = ["Hi", "I am fine, Thank You!"])
        
        
        BEFORE YOU CODE:
        MAKE SURE THAT THE INDEX OF THE QUESTION AND THE ANSWER LIST ARE THE SAME 
        FOR EXAMPLE: IF YOU WANT THE BOT TO SAY Hi WHEN THE USER ASKE'S hello AND 
        IF YOU WANT THE BOT TO SAY I am fine, Thank You! WHEN THE USER ASKE'S How are you doing
        THEN THE INDEX OR THE STRINGS HAVE TO BE IN THE SAME ORDER
        
        
        questions = ["Hello", "How are you doing"]
        
        
        answers = ["Hi", "I am fine, Thank You!"]
        
        
        Then it simple combines it in to a dictionary and then ask's the user for an input and 
        then prints out the responses
        
        
        
        2.jare_run_dictionary
        
        
        This is very similar to the 1st Command. Simply it takes two values the input value
        and the dictionary. Make sure that the dictionary is something like this:
        
        dictionary = {"Hello":"Hi", "How are you":"I am fine thank you!"}
        
        
        
        then ask's the user for an input and then prints out the responses
