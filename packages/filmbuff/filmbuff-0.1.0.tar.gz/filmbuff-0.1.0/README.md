# filmbuff (WIP)

## About

filmbuff is a GUI application used to create a local database of information
about films in your collection.

Typical database operations are present such as: creating entries (manually
or automatically using an outside source), querying entries, modifying entries,
and deleting entries.

After your database is complete, the information contained in the database can
be exported to a format useable with spreadsheet programs to make a printable
directory.
