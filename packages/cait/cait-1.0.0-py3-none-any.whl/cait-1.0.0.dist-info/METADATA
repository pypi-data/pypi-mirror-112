Cait (Cryogenic Artificial Intelligence Tools) is a Python 3 software package for the machine learning based analysis
of raw data from cryogenic dark matter experiments. It is tailored to the needs of the CRESST and COSINUS experiment,
but applicable to other, similar data structures.

**Documentation:** Preview: https://adoring-hoover-f7972f.netlify.app/

**Source Code:** https://git.cryocluster.org/fwagner/cait (for CRYOCLUSTER collaborations)

**Bug Report:** https://git.cryocluster.org/fwagner/cait/-/issues (for CRYOCLUSTER collaborations)


Installation
============

Cait is hosted on the Python package index.

.. code:: console

    $ pip install cait

You can now import the library in Python, e.g.

.. code:: python

    import cait as ai
    from cait import EventInterface
